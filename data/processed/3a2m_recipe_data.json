Bake in preheated oven at 350\\u00b0 for 25 minutes. While cookies are baking sift 1 cup confectioners sugar on a clean shallow pan or waxed paper spread on the counter. Cover the bottom thickly. Using a spatula transfer hot cookies onto sugar gently the moment you take them out of the oven. Do not pile them on top of each other but place them side by side as close as possible. Sift all the remaining sugar on top and sides through a strainer. Cool 4 hours before serving or transferring to a serving dish. The cookies are better the next day and keep well.",

I am not a huge fan of making cornbread as a round or square cake shape... they just are too messy that way. Instead I like to pour the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers. This recipe works great as muffins. I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees, but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25*F. less than the normal temperature... so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400*F. with a normal oven. It takes 20-23 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean. The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked.

EVERYONE loves this-.\", \"Additional options: I can bake it in a muffin pan (bake only 15 minutes); I can cut back on my sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup (or less). I can add just a smidgen more salt.

Bake for 5-7 minutes, just until barely starting to set in the center.\", \"5. While this is happening, pour the chocolate chips into a large microwave-safe bowl and dump the sweetened condensed milk over them. You don't have to stir at this point. Microwave on high for 45 seconds. Now stir well. If the chocolate is not melted after you beat vigorously for a few seconds, heat it for about 10 more seconds, and give it another try. Once your milk and chocolate have become one deliciously melted mixture, stir in the vanilla.\", \"6. When the peanut-butter base has finished its pre-bake, remove it from the oven, and pour your chocolate fudge evenly over the entire surface. It's easier to distribute by pouring rather than spreading, so take your time and disperse the chocolate mixture as equitably as possible over the base. Don't neglect the corners and edges.

    "directions": "[\"Rhubarb season in the Northeast US is pretty short, from April-May and fresh rhubarb is preferable when available. However, many grocery stores also carry frozen rhubarb, which will do nicely as well. I've read differing opinions on whether the rhubarb should be thawed first and patted dry of excess moisture, or whether it should just be dumped into the pie and cooking time extended. Not having tried this pie with frozen rhubarb, I'm not sure which is better, but I have a feeling that either will work as long as you watch your pie to make sure the filling is bubbling and the crust edge isn't overly brown (use a shield or aluminum foil around the edge if necessary). If you choose to fully thaw frozen rhubarb, however, definitely drain it before using. If you choose not to thaw first, I would just toss the rhubarb (and strawberries) with the flour and cornstarch before adding anything else.\", \"If you are concerned about the bottom crust getting soggy, there are 3 good options that should work: 1) bake the pie on the bottom rack; 2) pre-bake the bottom crust for about 10 minutes at 425F (with weights and an edge shield); 3) spread about 1/2 to 1 Tablespoons of flour on the bottom of the bottom crust before adding the filling.\", \"This pie recipe is presented 2 ways: one version has egg beaten into it, which results in a slightly custardy and delicious pie; while the other leaves out the egg and is strictly fruit-based. I prefer the egg beaten in, but they are both delicious. I include both ways because I made the egg-less pie first, and then I tried the pie with egg in the filling. The remainder of the ingredients are the same, except that you add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch to the egg-less pie to help it thicken. Cooking times/temperatures are the same for both.\", \"Directions:\", \"1. Decide whether you want to pre-treat the bottom crust (see above).\", \"2. Preheat the oven to 425F.\", \"3. If using egg, beat 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups sugar until fluffy (I used a whisk).\", \"4. Add the flour, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon and vanilla into the egg/sugar mixture (or just the 1 1/2 cups sugar if you don't want to use egg).\", \"5. Mix in the fruit and toss to coat.\", \"6.

If you want to make soft-sided, pull-apart rolls, divide the dough into 15 pieces. This isn't as challenging as it sounds: first, divide the dough into three equal pieces (about 375g, 14 ounces, each). Pinch off one piece, about the size of a racquetball or handball (75g, 2 3/4 ounces), off each of the three pieces, setting the pinched-off pieces aside; then simply divide what's left of the three pieces into four pieces each. Presto! Fifteen balls of dough. Gently roll the dough balls under your cupped fingers till they're nice and round. Place the 16 dough balls onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet or sheets, leaving about 2 inches between them. Or place the 15 dough balls into a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch pan, spacing them evenly in five rolls of three balls each. Cover the pan(s) with a proof cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the rolls to rise for about 2 hours, till they're quite puffy; the rolls in the 9 x 13-inch pan should be touching (or almost touching) one another. Baking: Bake the rolls in a preheated 350\\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, till they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, carefully turn them out of the pan -- the pull-apart rolls will come out all in one piece -- and brush them with melted butter, if desired.

In a bowl empty the cut chicken and squeeze the lime or lemon (or vinegar) onto the chicken, then add some water from your tap to cover the pieces of chicken. Now wash each piece individually, removing skin and any fat (we'll try to keep this a bit healthy). Now rinse with a new batch of water and drain.\\nNow in the same bowl with the freshly washed chicken you'll add ALL the ingredients EXCEPT the oil, sugar and cup of water, we'll be using those to cook the chicken. Here's what it should look like (remember to mix everything around and let it sit (marinate) in the fridge for about 1hr before cooking.\", \"Ok so at this point, you've just seasoned the chicken. After about an hour or so it time to get things moving. It's best if you could find a solid or heavy pan/pot, like a dutch oven for the actual cooking process. The heavier the pan, the better the oil will heat evenly and the chicken will caramelize for you. On high heat, add the oil to the pan. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the brown sugar. TIP - be sure to have the seasoned chicken handy, use a long handle spoon (it will get hot) and oven mitts to hold onto the pot to turn the pieces of chicken to get it evenly coated. It's important that you keep an eye on things and be ready to act fast. Next tip - it can get a bit smoky with the high heat at this point, so you may want to turn the exhaust fan over your stove on or open a window in the event you have smoke detectors installed.\", \"Move around the sugar in the pot (remember to use a dry spoon with a long handle), until it starts to melt. Now keep a close eye on things here, since you're looking for the sugar to go a bit foamy, and change color to golden. See pic below. Notice the bottom left of the picture where the sugar appears a bit darker? That's the exact color you're looking for before adding the chicken.\", \"At this point you can start adding the pieces of chicken into the pot with the caramelized sugar. Try to be quick, since you don't want the sugar to go much darker than in the picture above. Be sure to coat every piece of chicken so it \\\"browns\\\" evenly. Now cover the pot and let simmer for about 5 -10 minutes. you'll notice that the pot will now have some excess water in it.\", \"Remove the lid and turn the heat back up to high. Let's get rid of that water that formed earlier.We're ensuring that all the pieces of meat is nice an golden brown at this point. Ensure that there's no water left in the pot.. it will seems as if it's starting to stick or burn.\\nNow add the cup of water to the bowl that contained the seasoned chicken. Swish it around so you get all the seasoning bits that were left back. Add this water to the pot so you can continue cooking the chicken for another 25 minutes or so. Turn the heat back down to a simmer and let cook until the water thickens up to a nice gravy like consistency.\", \"Couple points..\\nSalt - be sure to taste near the end to add extra salt as to your liking.\\nSauce - my mom hates allowing any form of sauce with her stew chicken, she like it to \\\"fry down\\\" so it dry.

silver spoon.\", \"Wood and silver disguise flavor on the tongue.\", \"A good soup really needs salt, preferably coarse salt.\", \"If you must avoid salt, know that the flavor will be greatly diminished.\", \"Adding no-salt or low-sodium broth concentrate will help.\", \"Don't turn your nose up at this: Chicken feet add not only robust flavor, but gelatinous body to the soup.\", \"You can find them at many Asian markets.\", \"Fresh chicken feet need to be scalded about five minutes so the skin and toenails can be removed before adding to the stockpot.\", \"Calf feet, veal knuckles and beef marrow bones achieve the same goal.\", \"Bones also leach nutritious calcium and minerals into the soup.\", \"If at all possible, do not use chicken that has been frozen.\", \"Freezing forces moisture from the tissues.\", \"When the bird is thawed, all that moisture ends up down the drain, leaving a dry and tasteless chicken.\", \"Unthawed frozen vegetables should not be added to the soup until the last 15 minutes of cooking time.\", \"Use tall, nonreactive stockpots for making soup.\", \"Fit the bird to the pot.\", \"The base should be just large enough to hold the bird and to cover it with a minimum of water.\", \"A pot of heavy construction distributes heat more evenly.\", \"To skim or not to skim?\", \"For clear soups, many recipes advocate skimming off the foamy solids that rise to the top as the soup cooks.\", \"However, there is not only flavor, but nutrition in those solids that will break down as the soup cooks.\", \"You can sieve the broth before adding vegetables.\", \"For a clearer broth, sift through cheesecloth.\", \"Or, you can skim.\", \"The choice is yours.\", \"Don't let the soup boil.\", \"It should simmer very gently or the meat will become tough and the broth cloudy.\", \"Dark meat has more flavor than white meat.\", \"If you are using chicken parts rather than a whole chicken, keep this in mind.\", \"Using only all white meat will result in a much less flavorful result.\", \"For those concerned about fat, make the soup in two stages.\", \"Cook the chicken with its aromatic vegetables and herbs on one day.\", \"Strain the meat and flavorings from the broth.\", \"Refrigerate the broth until the fat solidifies on top.\", \"Save the fat for other uses or discard.\", \"Continue with the soup.\", \"Do keep in mind that the majority of the flavor is in the fat.\", \"If you are planning ahead, cook the chicken with vegetables and herbs.\", \"Freeze the strained stock.\", \"If your planned future use includes chicken meat, freeze the meat in the stock to keep it from drying out.\", \"You can later thaw and add fresh vegetables, pasta or rice.\", \"For a richer broth, remove the chicken from the bones as soon as it is tender and refrigerate.\", \"Add the bones back to the soup and continue simmering until desired strength is achieved.\", \"Strain and proceed.\", \"Cool soup completely before freezing or refrigerating, preferably by placing the pot in a sink of ice and stirring.\", \"The pot should be uncovered while it is cooling.\", \"In the Kitchen Basic chicken soup begins with a broth made by cooking the chicken with savory vegetables (such as onions, carrots, and celery) and herbs (usually sage, thyme, bay leaf and parsley).\", \"From the basic stock, you can vary your soup by adding your favorite vegetables, pasta or rice.\", \"Combinations for chicken soup are as limitless as your imagination.\", \"The chicken soup recipe collection covers a wide variety to give you an idea how versatile this family favorite can be, from classic chicken noodle soup to mulligatawny.\", \"Remember, turkey can be substituted for chicken in most recipes.\", \"Above all, the prime ingredient in chicken soup is love.\", \"Luckily, it is the one ingredient accessible to all in infinite quantities, and you cannot use too much of it.\"]",
