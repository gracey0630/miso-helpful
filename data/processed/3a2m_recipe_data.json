I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees, but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25*F. less than the normal temperature... so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400*F. with a normal oven.

    "recipe_name": "Strawberry Rhubarb Pie",
    "directions": "[\"Rhubarb season in the Northeast US is pretty short, from April-May and fresh rhubarb is preferable when available. However, many grocery stores also carry frozen rhubarb, which will do nicely as well. I've read differing opinions on whether the rhubarb should be thawed first and patted dry of excess moisture, or whether it should just be dumped into the pie and cooking time extended. Not having tried this pie with frozen rhubarb, I'm not sure which is better, but I have a feeling that either will work as long as you watch your pie to make sure the filling is bubbling and the crust edge isn't overly brown (use a shield or aluminum foil around the edge if necessary). If you choose to fully thaw frozen rhubarb, however, definitely drain it before using. If you choose not to thaw first, I would just toss the rhubarb (and strawberries) with the flour and cornstarch before adding anything else.\", \"If you are concerned about the bottom crust getting soggy, there are 3 good options that should work: 1) bake the pie on the bottom rack; 2) pre-bake the bottom crust for about 10 minutes at 425F (with weights and an edge shield); 3) spread about 1/2 to 1 Tablespoons of flour on the bottom of the bottom crust before adding the filling.\", \"This pie recipe is presented 2 ways: one version has egg beaten into it, which results in a slightly custardy and delicious pie; while the other leaves out the egg and is strictly fruit-based. I prefer the egg beaten in, but they are both delicious. I include both ways because I made the egg-less pie first, and then I tried the pie with egg in the filling. The remainder of the ingredients are the same, except that you add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch to the egg-less pie to help it thicken. Cooking times/temperatures are the same for both.\", \"Directions:\", \"1. Decide whether you want to pre-treat the bottom crust (see above).\", \"2. Preheat the oven to 425F.\", \"3. If using egg, beat 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups sugar until fluffy (I used a whisk).\", \"4. Add the flour, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon and vanilla into the egg/sugar mixture (or just the 1 1/2 cups sugar if you don't want to use egg).\", \"5. Mix in the fruit and toss to coat.\", \"6. Pour the filling into the bottom crust, and dot on the butter.\", \"7. Brush bottom pie crust with egg wash (1 egg white beaten with 1 teaspoon of water).\", \"8. Cover with the top crust, crimping to seal. Brush egg wash over the top crust and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.\", \"9. Collar pie with foil or shield, and bake for 15 minutes at 425F.\", \"10. Without opening the door, lower the oven temperature to 375F and bake for an additional 45 minutes or so, until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden.\", \"10.

When well blended, add a bit of the flour, then a bit of the cornstarch, stirring in between each addition until everything is well blended. Sifting would be best, if you have a sifter (I don't, but I still managed).\", \"Continue stirring, and slowly add the milk mixture. Once completely integrated in to the egg solution, transfer the whole lot back in to the sauce pan. Maintain a medium heat, and stir constantly until the custard reached a boil. If you're like me, you'll end with lumps ANYWAY, so remove from heat and beat vigorously with a whisk.\", \"Cut the butter in to cubes, and stir in to the custard, making sure each cube is fully melted before adding the next (not really necessary, probably, but that's how I did it, so I can't guarantee proper performance without doing this). There will probably be lumps again, so go at it once more with the whisk.\", \"Add the Frangelico and blend once more (whew), cover with cling wrap, and put the bowl in the fridge while you prepare the bread.

S.l.o.w.l.y mix with a whisk until just combined (it will be flaky).\", \"Add the sugar, along with the fully activated yeast and egg, and stir with a wooden spoon (or a plastic spoon - just don't use a whisk).\", \"Flour your work surface, and turn out the dough once combined. Knead until the mixture holds together well. If it's a little too sticky to handle well, add some more flour.\", \"Flatten the dough with your hands. Put the unsalted butter (NOT margarine - it will not work as well!) on the newly-flattened dough, and massage it into the dough. This could take a while. Once you've got it all worked in, continue to knead the dough until it is smooth (or very near to it). This, again, could take a while.\", \"Coat a bowl with cooking spray or vegetable oil. Form the dough into a ball, toss into the bowl, cover with cling wrap and let rest (NOT in the fridge) for about 3/4 of an hour.\", \"Push down on the dough ball with both hands, gently, until all the gas has escaped.

Press each ball in to a disc, recover with cling wrap and let them rest for another 15 minutes, again.\", \"Flatten the discs again, and roll out with your rolling pin until they form neat little circles, no thicker or thinner than a 1/4\\\".\", \"Hold each disc in a cupped hand, and add about 1 tablespoon of custard in the middle of each. Close the dough around the custard, but don't stretch out the top and be sure to seal the seams tightly. Try not to overfill the pastry with custard, because if you do it will prevent the edges from holding well.\", \"Place the unattractive seam of the dough balls face down on a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Cover again with cling wrap (I know, I know) and let sit for another 1/2 hour to 3/4 of an hour. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 400\\u00b0F.\", \"If you want, throw together 1 tablespoons of egg white (left over from the yolks used in the custard) with 1 tablespoons of water and brush over the top of the buns, but this isn't absolutely necessary.

If you want to make soft-sided, pull-apart rolls, divide the dough into 15 pieces. This isn't as challenging as it sounds: first, divide the dough into three equal pieces (about 375g, 14 ounces, each). Pinch off one piece, about the size of a racquetball or handball (75g, 2 3/4 ounces), off each of the three pieces, setting the pinched-off pieces aside; then simply divide what's left of the three pieces into four pieces each. Presto! Fifteen balls of dough. Gently roll the dough balls under your cupped fingers till they're nice and round. Place the 16 dough balls onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet or sheets, leaving about 2 inches between them. Or place the 15 dough balls into a lightly greased 9 x 13-inch pan, spacing them evenly in five rolls of three balls each. Cover the pan(s) with a proof cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the rolls to rise for about 2 hours, till they're quite puffy; the rolls in the 9 x 13-inch pan should be touching (or almost touching) one another. Baking: Bake the rolls in a preheated 350\\u00b0F oven for 20 to 25 minutes, till they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, carefully turn them out of the pan -- the pull-apart rolls will come out all in one piece -- and brush them with melted butter, if desired.

    "recipe_name": "Tasty Trinidad Style Stew Chicken",
    "directions": "[\"Preparing the chicken. Cut or ask your butcher to cut the chicken into serving size pieces. In a bowl empty the cut chicken and squeeze the lime or lemon (or vinegar) onto the chicken, then add some water from your tap to cover the pieces of chicken. Now wash each piece individually, removing skin and any fat (we'll try to keep this a bit healthy). Now rinse with a new batch of water and drain.\\nNow in the same bowl with the freshly washed chicken you'll add ALL the ingredients EXCEPT the oil, sugar and cup of water, we'll be using those to cook the chicken. Here's what it should look like (remember to mix everything around and let it sit (marinate) in the fridge for about 1hr before cooking.\", \"Ok so at this point, you've just seasoned the chicken. After about an hour or so it time to get things moving. It's best if you could find a solid or heavy pan/pot, like a dutch oven for the actual cooking process. The heavier the pan, the better the oil will heat evenly and the chicken will caramelize for you. On high heat, add the oil to the pan. Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the brown sugar. TIP - be sure to have the seasoned chicken handy, use a long handle spoon (it will get hot) and oven mitts to hold onto the pot to turn the pieces of chicken to get it evenly coated. It's important that you keep an eye on things and be ready to act fast. Next tip - it can get a bit smoky with the high heat at this point, so you may want to turn the exhaust fan over your stove on or open a window in the event you have smoke detectors installed.\", \"Move around the sugar in the pot (remember to use a dry spoon with a long handle), until it starts to melt. Now keep a close eye on things here, since you're looking for the sugar to go a bit foamy, and change color to golden. See pic below. Notice the bottom left of the picture where the sugar appears a bit darker? That's the exact color you're looking for before adding the chicken.\", \"At this point you can start adding the pieces of chicken into the pot with the caramelized sugar. Try to be quick, since you don't want the sugar to go much darker than in the picture above. Be sure to coat every piece of chicken so it \\\"browns\\\" evenly. Now cover the pot and let simmer for about 5 -10 minutes. you'll notice that the pot will now have some excess water in it.\", \"Remove the lid and turn the heat back up to high. Let's get rid of that water that formed earlier.We're ensuring that all the pieces of meat is nice an golden brown at this point. Ensure that there's no water left in the pot.. it will seems as if it's starting to stick or burn.\\nNow add the cup of water to the bowl that contained the seasoned chicken. Swish it around so you get all the seasoning bits that were left back. Add this water to the pot so you can continue cooking the chicken for another 25 minutes or so. Turn the heat back down to a simmer and let cook until the water thickens up to a nice gravy like consistency.\", \"Couple points..\\nSalt - be sure to taste near the end to add extra salt as to your liking.\\nSauce - my mom hates allowing any form of sauce with her stew chicken, she like it to \\\"fry down\\\" so it dry. Makes for a more unique and traditional flavor. But I like to leave it with sauce or gravy so I can put it on a bed of brown rice.\"]"
