It has the double use of flavouring the pasta water, so if you\u2019re using a splash for your sauce it\u2019s got a more umami, meaty flavour, and it also doubles the tastiness of your pasta. Trust me.\n\nSecondly - using scissors to cut just about anything I can. It always seems to weird people out when I cut up chicken thighs in particular, but it\u2019s so good for cutting out those fiddly veins. I could honestly never go back to cutting them up using a knife.",

Stopped that entirely, just made sure I salted my water, got a good whirlpool going with the bottom flat end of a slotted spoon, took them out at 2:45 and they're perfect every time.\n\n2) adding a pinch of baking powder  to onions when caramelizing them. I've found it affects the flavor negatively (makes them slightly bitter) and mushier. It may reduce cooking time a bit but the results aren't worth it, there's no substitute for low & slow and patience.\n\nWhat are some \"hacks\" you've found really aren't?\n\nEdit: baking soda, not baking powder.

A story for another time, I moved to Germany 9 years ago and continued my culinary career. As an American cook who suddenly finds himself in a European kitchen, you notice right away they don't have any of the equipment we are used to to measure ingredients. There is no quart or pint, there is no gallon (they do use measuring spoon measurements) but there is basically no way to make a volume measurement (other than 1 and 2 liter measuring pitchers) What they do have is a professional kitchen scale, and man it's great.\n\n1 liter of water is essentially 1kg of water. 1 liter of milk is essentially 1 kg, 1 liter of whipping cream ... You get the point. You put a pot on the scale and adjust to Zero. In goes 1kg of cream. 250g sugar. 10g salt. You'll need 300g butter. Just throw it all into the pot, bam you have a recipe. Nothing to measure, just watching the scale hit it's mark. It has changed my life. Let me give you a sample ice cream recipe:\n\n500g milk\n500g cream\n5g salt\n150g sugar\n250g egg yolk\n1 tsp vanilla\n\nDo you see how nice and round that recipe is? It takes me 45 seconds to throw that together at work. Now I have books and books filled with nice round recipes that I can save huge amounts of time preparing and they are exactly the same every time. It's insane how much more efficient it is to not just prepare this way, but to record the information this way. And not just for baking and such. I have dips and dressings, sauces and salsas, all recorded nice and round by weight. \n\nReally glad I got to see this method in action and learn it's brilliance, really is a kitchen life hack.\n\nPS: I bought the CIA student book 2 years ago, just as a reference to have at home, and going back to pints and gallons and all these weird fractions was a nightmare!

        "title": "Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.",
        "selftext": "Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nIn January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.\n\nUnfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.\n\nOf course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nNetflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88\nCrunchyroll|Annual|$79.99|$6.67|$79.99\nAmazon Prime|Annual|$139.00|$11.58|$139.00\nOn Demand Korea|Annual|$139.99|$11.67|$139.99\nYoutube Premium|Monthly|$22.99|$22.99|$275.88\nSpotify|Monthly|$19.99|$19.99\t|$239.88\nT-Mobile|Monthly\t|$100.00\t|$100.00\t|$1,200.00\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nLastPass\t|Monthly\t|$4.00\t|$4.00\t|$48.00\nChase Sapphire Reserve\t|Annual\t|$550.00\t|$45.83\t|$550.00\n\nThe above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.\n\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nStremio + RD\t|Annual\t|$34.54\t|$2.88\t|$34.54\nOn Demand Korea\t|Annual\t|$139.99\t|$11.67\t|$139.99\nYoutube Premium\t|Monthly\t|$22.99\t|$22.99\t|$275.88\t\t\t\nMint Mobile\t|Annual\t|409.28\t|$34.11\t|$409.28\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nBitwarden\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\nAAA Daily Advantage\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\n\nThe new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.\n\n* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  \n* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.\n\n* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.\n\n* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.\n\n* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).\n\n* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.\n\n* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.\n\nOther things I did to reduce costs:\n\n* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.\n\n* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.\n\n* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.\n\n* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still \"young\", it will suffice.\n\nAll in, I am saving the following:\n\nItem\t|Old Monthly Cost\t|New Monthly Cost\t|Total Monthly Savings\t|Total Annual Savings\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\nSubscription Services\t|$242.38\t|$73.31\t|$169.08\t|$2,028.93\nAmazon shopping\t|$100.00\t|$30.00\t|$70.00\t|$840.00\nBaked goods\t|$35.00\t|$5.00\t|$30.00\t|$360.00\nTake-out\t|$150.00\t|$35.00\t|$115.00\t|$1380.00\nHealth Insurance\t|$1,600.00\t|$950.00\t|$650.00\t|$7,800.00\nTotal\t|$2,127.38\t|$1,093.31\t|$1034.08\t|$12,408.93\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this.  I hope this will give someone some ideas on how they can cut out extraneous expenses from their lives.  Given how the economy is moving, many of us may need these tips sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are some other things you have done to reduce your recurring costs?  I'd love to try to minimize my costs even further if I can.",

I\u2019ve been cooking since I was 10 and I even have a personal cookbook of the recipes I\u2019ve accumulated over the years. I know my recipes to heart so much so that I often don\u2019t need a recipe to cook my dishes.\n\nMy closest friends and I decided to have dinner and board game night last week to which my best friend Clark (34M) volunteered to host. He requested me to cook my spicy Italian sausage pasta and said that I could cook my pasta dish at his house. He even joked that he gets to keep any of the leftovers (which was fine by me). I agreed to this arrangement because his kitchen was equipped for me to cook my dish, and I didn\u2019t need to worry about transporting my dish.\n\nI arrived at Clark\u2019s house a few hours early with my ingredients in tow along with board games from my collection (yes, I\u2019m a board gamer too). Clark\u2019s girlfriend of 4 months, Sasha (32F), let me in the house. I asked her where Clark was, and she said he was out doing errands and buying snacks and refreshments for later. I proceeded to the kitchen to prepare the ingredients and start cooking.\n\nMy cooking of the sauce went well. The flavors were balanced to my liking. It had saltiness from the pancetta and the parmesan rind, sweetness and tartness from the onions and canned and fresh tomatoes, heat from Calabrian chiles, and herbaceous notes from a blend of fresh and dried herbs. After finishing the sauce, I took it off the heat and prepared a pot of water for the pasta. I then set the pot of water over the stove but put it over low heat. I planned to freshen up a little and cook the pasta nearer the serving time. I then went to the guest bathroom to shower and change clothes. After freshening up, I headed back to the kitchen.\n\nOn my way back, I asked Sasha, who was in the living room, where Clark was. She said that he was on his way and would be back in 20 minutes. She then told me this: \u201cOh, by the way, I tasted your tomato sauce, and it lacks salt. I saw this video and the chef said that the sauce should be as salty as the sea. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already fixed your sauce. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d I thought she was kidding so I just responded with: \u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d I was also worried if she oversalted my sauce.\n\nI quickly made my way back to the kitchen to taste my sauce, to my horror my complex, balanced sauce was now as salty as the Dead Sea. I was fuming because my sauce was ruined by, in Gordon Ramsay\u2019s words, an \u201cIdiot Sandwich\u201d. She definitely misheard the advice from the video because you\u2019re supposed to have the PASTA WATER as salty as the sea, not the sauce.\n\nI wanted to scold Sasha for ruining my sauce, but I had to fix my sauce first because my friends were bound to arrive in less than an hour. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the time or the ingredients to make a new sauce. I added a mix of lemon juice and honey, a can of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and splashes of water. I minimized the saltiness of the sauce, but the sauce was still off. I was thinking of no longer serving my dish, but my friends were excited about my food, and I didn\u2019t want to waste food. I just hoped no one would notice how bad the sauce was.\n\nMy friends arrived, we all sat at the dinner table, and we all got a portion of each dish. While we were eating, I noticed my friends were pushing my pasta to the sides of their plates. Once everyone was ready for dessert, I offered to help Lexi prepare and serve the desserts (Lexi is also a foodie but she\u2019s a baker and she\u2019s excellent at making pastries and desserts). When Lexi and I were alone in the kitchen, she asked me why my pasta was so salty. That\u2019s when I told her everything. I then told Lexi that I\u2019d let it go for the meantime, and we should just enjoy the rest of the night.\n\nI was doing so well to not show I was bothered but then Clark, along with Sasha, approached me and said my pasta dish was saltier than he remembered. I wanted to say that his GF ruined my dish, but I decided to allow her to own up for her mistake. So, I told him that I had no idea what went wrong. I mentioned that I properly salted my food, tasted the sauce as I went along, and made it a point to say my pasta water was \u201csea water salty\u201d but that has never affected the saltiness of my pasta dishes.  When I said the pasta water thing, I made sure to look at Sasha. She did not say anything. I just ended the conversation by saying I sometimes have my \u201coff\u201d days.\n\nThe rest of the night went well, I even won some of the games, which kind of lifted my spirits from the pasta debacle. Before I left Clark's house, I asked him if he was keeping the leftovers. He said he was taking half, so I offered to take home the other half.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week since the pasta incident and I still feel disrespected by what Sasha did. I want to tell my best friend that his GF fucked up my dish but I don't wanna make a big issue over pasta sauce.\n\nHow would you go about this?\n\n==========\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: I've been reading everyone's comments and I would like to thank everyone for their advice.\n\nI generally feel uncomfortable with confrontations which is why I let it slide and even took the blame. But now I realize that I should stand up for myself more, be more proud of the work I do and I shouldn't be concerned about sparing Sasha's feelings because, in the first place, she disrespected me. I have to put her in her place.\n\nSome of you thought that she either hated me or was jealous of me. I have no idea if she does. In the 4 months, Clark and her have been dating, I've only met her twice or thrice and we didn't even interact much. I'm now even more compelled to tell Clark about what she did because if she's able to disrespect the boundaries of a stranger to her, who knows what boundaries she'll cross with a romantic partner?\n\nI've messaged Clark to meet up (without Sasha) for lunch tomorrow, and he agreed. I'll probably update everyone after my lunch with Clark.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** \"Your GF emptied the salt container in the sauce after I finished it. I tried to fix it, but ... well, you tasted the result.\"\n\n**Commenter 2:** I'd have told the truth as soon as it came up. I'd also have told Sasha I didn't appreciate her \"help.\"\n\n**Commenter 3:** You should NOT have protected her, especially in the conversation with Clark. YOU SHOULD HAVE OUTED HER IDIOCY RIGHT THEN AND THERE. Why didn't you? That's not \"being polite\" -- that's \"being a doormat\". Stop that. Find your spine and stand up for yourself. Now everyone thinks YOU screwed up instead of the real fact that his idiot girlfriend ruined it.\n\n**Commenter 4:** I am now very angry with OP for not saying anything , when the issue came up than I am with Sasha for staying quiet \u2026 \ud83d\ude24\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update (unddit)](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1irg9qs/update_my_best_friends_gf_ruined_my_food_i_dont/?sort=confidence&share_id=jBGI0ZpfcdYwcPHkmpmC1) **February 17 2025 (next day)**\n\nThank you for all the comments and advice on my previous post.\n\nI met with Clark for lunch to tell him about last week\u2019s board game night. I told him that Sasha oversalted my sauce because of a video she saw, and I tried my best to fix it but failed. I also allowed her to fess up, but she stayed silent. I apologized for lying to him by taking the blame for her mistake because I was afraid of confrontation, and I didn\u2019t want the rest of the game night to be ruined by throwing her under the bus.\n\nI was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t believe me and that I was deflecting the blame back to Sasha, instead, he said, \u201cThat makes much more sense.\u201d He then told me more about Sasha.\n\nWhen he met Sasha, she was trying to make lifestyle content. Currently, she wants to make cooking videos but the videos she watched for inspiration were cooking \u201chacks\u201d where people were dumping dried pasta, raw meat, tons of cheese, etc. in a baking dish and then throwing it in the oven to \u201ccook\u201d. She even saw the countertop spaghetti video which she wanted to make for Clark\u2019s dad and sister when they were over at his house during the holidays. He refused to let her do that.\n\nBefore we finished our meal, I told Clark to talk to his GF and I expect an apology from her and for her to also apologize to the rest of our friends for ruining last week's dinner. He asked me if I wanted to go to his place to get an apology now because Sasha was there. I declined because it would feel like we were forcing an apology from her by surprising her.\n\nAfter a few hours, I got a call from Clark. They got into a huge fight, and they broke up. When he asked her to apologize, she refused and threw a fit. She was so annoyed that Clark would rave about me and Lexi\u2019s food but never did the same when she cooked for him. He said that he always thanked and appreciated her efforts but sometimes her cooking didn\u2019t go well (she served him raw chicken twice). In her rant, she said that her \u201cfixing\u201d the sauce was her way of saying that she was better than me but when her plan backfired, she kept quiet and let me take the blame (and I dumbly fell on that sword).  \n\n(Some of you in the comments from the previous post were right.)  \n\nBut what got Clark to break up with her was when she called Clark and our friend group, \u201ca bunch of useless losers.\u201d He, in turn, defended us by saying that we were the most reliable supportive group of friends he\u2019s ever had (we helped him get through his mom\u2019s terminal cancer diagnosis and passing). He told her to get out and they were over.\n\nClark assured me he\u2019d be okay, and he needed some space. I told him to call if he needed anything.\n\nIt seems I won\u2019t be getting my apology but that\u2019s what I get for not speaking up. Lesson learned. At least we won\u2019t have Sasha for our next game night which I\u2019ll host.\n\n**Top Comments** \n\n**Commenter 1:** I'm glad you told your friend the truth, and she ended up exposing herself as a red flag! Hope your turn hosting game night goes well!\n\n**Commenter 2:** And that OP is why you need to stand up for yourself and not expect other people to do it for you.\n\nWell done, Clark suspected already, this is definitely crazy that came from her and you have cut toxic shit out of your friend group.\n\nDecent adulting, if there is a next time, call out the BS earlier.\n\n**Commenter 3:** Those cooking videos where the people dump everything into a pan and let it cook are utterly disgusting.  I\u2019ve seen one where they dump store pasta, water, raw mince into a baking dish and then add way too much salt before covering the entire thing with velveeta cheese.  They are utterly disgusting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

Trust me. The other is using scissors to cut just about anything I can. It always seems to weird people out when I cut up chicken thighs in particular, but it\u2019s so good for cutting out those fiddly veins.

        "title": "Are HSR's devs really getting lazy with events?",
        "selftext": "Lately, I've had a bit of free time thanks to HSR, so I decided to make some spreadsheets and a Google Doc just to help you visualize this better. My take? Quantity-wise, not much has changed since the game's release. But quality-wise, I'd say that there's been a pretty big decline.\n\nI've also been seeing some ridiculous takes these last few months:\n\n***\"Don't complain, it has always been like that\"***  \nYou could just say \"I want the game to stagnate and never improve\" and it would be the same thing.\n\n***\"I don't care about the lack of events, I'd even prefer having no events at all so the game can respect my time even more\"***  \nWhich means \"The game doesn't have content so I have to cope\" or \"I don't want to play the game, I just want free jades to gamble while I rotate between my 10 other gacha games\". People using time as an excuse are so funny, if you listened to them you'd think they're all neurosurgeons with 5 kids. As if playing a game for more than 2 min a day would kill them. I had genuinely never seen players praising a game's lack of content before HSR.\n\n**\"But the Divergent Universe...\"** That's not an even an event but a game mode that lots of players do only once a week. I'd even bet that most players don't even play it regularly and just wait until the last few weeks to complete it, which would be why Hoyo decided to add double exp for the entire 3.0 update.\n\n**\"Hoyoverse wants the HSR players to rotate between their games\"**  \nDo you think most HSR players also plays Genshin or ZZZ? Do you have any stats backing up the fact that there's a significant overlap between the playerbases? Sure, plenty of HSR players also play Genshin or/and ZZZ, of course, but what makes you even think those who don't would suddenly pick up those games instead of just trying something else, whether it's another gacha or a more traditional game? If I follow that logic, I could say \"Yeah, Riot Games must be sabotaging League of Legends just to make players start playing Valorant too\" but would they really? They're not even from the same genre, one is a MOBA, the other is a tactical shooter just like how Genshin is an open-world action-RPG, HSR is turn-based RPG, and ZZZ is more of a hack n' slash.\n\n***\"The game has lost in quality after ZZZ's release, just like Genshin did with HSR. The same will happen to ZZZ when Hoyo releases their next game.\"***  \nFor some reason I've seen some people say this almost as if they want it to happen but what even makes you say this happens with each release in the first place? HSR was released on April 26, 2023, a few weeks before Genshin's version 3.7, a few patches before Fontaine. Do you really think the game declined past version 3.7? Personally, I don't think it did.  \nEven the number of pulls you got per patch increased in Fontaine (76.74 pulls/patch) compared to Sumeru (73.24 pulls/patch), and it went up even more in Natlan (87.5 pulls/patch as of 5.4). And even if the games decline after each new release, what good does it do to HSR to wish for the other Hoyo games to fail? Is \"My game is declining but yours is too so it's completely fine\" what you want to say?\n\n***\"Big events like Aetherium Wars only happen during patches with no Trailblaze Mission. And version 3.1's quest is 7 hours long so that's why we can't get a big event\"***  \nFirst point is true but they have the resources to do so much more. The quest being 7h long such an easy thing to mindlessly repeat when Genshin and ZZZ have been getting solid events even during main story patches and they're still getting 1 or 2 character story quests on top of that.  \nZZZ's 1.6 had a 4-hour-long main quest, Anby's 2-hour-long story and Trigger's upcoming agent story, yet it still managed to deliver 3.5 times more events than HSR's 3.1.  \nGenshin's 5.1 featured a 6-hour Archon Quest and a 2-hour event quest dedicated to Nahida. Then in 5.3, the Archon Quest was 3.5 hours long and we still got a great 3-hour Lantern Rite story. And that's just the last few patches. I've also heard that Amphoreus' storyline is supposed to last until 3.7 or something like that so... am I supposed to expect no major events (aside from the Fate collab) until the next planet?\n\n***\"I'd rather have no events at all than have mini-games like Genshin's Puyo Puyo-like, Prop Hunt mode or ZZZ's Fall Guys-like\"***  \nKind of a weird take in my opinion, but to each their own, I guess? Personally, I found these modes pretty fun. Mini-games aside, what about the story quests, the character interactions, and the fact that these events were voiced?\n\n***\"HSR is meant to be a side game so go play something else or go outside\"***  \nI personally do play other games but what about the players who would like to spend more time on the game than you and me? Some of them have spent money to get some characters and would want to do more than just log into the game, do their dailies in under 2 minutes and log out every day.  \nIn comparison, ZZZ gets so many more events and its endgame modes resets bi-weekly, Genshin also gets more events than HSR while being an open-world game.  \nAnd seriously, what the hell is a \"side game\", has Hoyoverse ever said that they wanted HSR to be a side game? That's just your perception, many players treat or want to treat HSR as one of their main games and expect more content and events than just 1 auto-play event and \n\n***\"They're cooking something huge for the 3.2 since it's the anniversary\"***  \nSome players have been saying this since 2.6, I think? \"2.6 is mid because they're preparing something for 2.7\" > \"2.7 too? They must be cooking for the 3.0 with Amphoreus\" > \"B-but the 25 min-long puzzle event is so stimulating and complex, they'll do even better in 3.1\" > \"3.2, despite being the anniversary patch, is so dry because of the Fate collab, trust me it'll be the greatest collab of all time for sure\".\n\n***\"But the game's revenue shows that my game is better\"***  \nWho cares about revenue? Some people always bring up revenue in discussions when it suits them \"Of course HSR is better! It makes more money than x\" but when someone uses that argument against them \"Genshin is better than HSR because revenue\" they'll suddenly be like \"Revenue is inaccurate so it doesn't matter\". They're from the same company, by the way, so why does it matter so much to some people? And if revenue is that important to you, I'm guessing your favorite movie and book series must be Avatar and Harry Potter, right? Imagine praising a piece of media not for its quality but for the money it made, absolutely ridiculous.\n\nDid I miss anything?  \nI swear, some people will defend anything, not because they actually like the game, but because they've spent so much time or money (or both) into the game that they now see it as some kind of investment that needs to be protected at all cost. They'll always want less content but more jades, absolutely refuse to play the game, and do everything on auto-mode because they \"don't have the time to play\". I'm not saying auto-mode is bad but some people actually say things like \"the game is good because I don't have to play it thanks to the auto-mode\" which is just so strange. If all I wanted was to gamble, I'd bet on some sports team or buy lottery tickets instead of playing this game.  \nI know that I compared HSR with Genshin and ZZZ a lot but they're from the same company so it shouldn't be a problem for anyone, right?",

        "title": "HOA destroyed my rare succulent collection because I had \u201ctoo many plants\u201d",
        "selftext": "When I left Los Angeles after fifteen years of petty theft, grime, and constant noise, I thought I was finally finding peace. I rented a townhome in what seemed like a clean, safe neighborhood, perfect for my ten-year-old son and for working remotely. The kitchen was huge, the kind of place where I could finally spread out and cook again. Out front was a patio area where I could display my lifelong collection of succulents.\n\nI\u2019m a botanist and plant collector, and some of those plants were over twenty years old. Brightly colored aloes and agaves, all in hand-thrown Italian clay pots. The HOA rules said we could have plants in front of the unit as long as they were alive and didn\u2019t block anything, so I set them up with care. Neighbors often stopped to admire them or ask questions. For a while, everything felt right.\n\nThen came the first warning. The HOA fined me $50 because my ten-year-old son couldn\u2019t lift a heavy trash bag into the bin. They said they had video evidence. That\u2019s when I realized the entire place was under constant surveillance, cameras pointed everywhere, even catching him playing with a soccer ball outside.\n\nA few months later, I got an email saying I had too many plants. That was the violation. Too many. I replied with a full breakdown of the species, explaining that they barely used water compared to the fruit trees and vegetable planters other residents had. Two days later, I came home to find my collection hacked apart. Rare agaves and aloes that had taken decades to grow had been cut to pieces by a gardener the HOA sent without my consent.\n\nWhen I demanded an explanation, they said the gardener \u201cmisunderstood\u201d directions, then tried to claim the space outside my door was community property. It wasn\u2019t. It was the frontage of my rented unit, with no easement or sidewalk. I told them that if they ever touched my plants again, I\u2019d take them to court and sent them an estimate for the damages. They went silent.\n\nMonths later, when wildfire ash covered everything, I heard a familiar sound outside. The same gardener was back, blowing ash into the air with a leaf blower despite a city ban. I ran outside, told him to stop or I\u2019d call the police. He turned it off right away, said he thought it was stupid too, but was told to do it.\n\nThat was the last straw. I moved out. Now I live in a duplex where my landlord actually appreciates my collection and the water isn\u2019t so full of chlorine that it hurts the plants.\n\nUpdate: Nov 16, I am sending a demand letter and will take them to small claims, thanks for the encouragement \nWhat I learned is simple: HOAs are a waste of time. They exist to control, not to build community. I\u2019ll never live under one again.",

        "title": "Republican gerrymandering in North Carolina handed Trump control of Congress. Democrats must match Republican gerrymandering - for now at least. - Rep. Wiley Nickel",
        "selftext": "In 2023, I was gerrymandered out of my seat in Congress. The three House seats we lost in North Carolina were ultimately the difference in control of the 119th Congress. If our North Carolina maps had been fair, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries would be the Speaker of the House with a razor thin 218-217 majority and things would look very different in Washington. Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill would have been dead on arrival and Democrats would have protected America from another round of billionaire tax giveaways and major cuts to Medicaid.\n\nA fair system created by non-partisan independent redistricting is the only way for our democracy to survive.\n\nThe mid-decade redistricting by Republicans in Texas is not normal. If Texas is allowed to flip five seats from Democrat to Republican with the stroke of a pen it\u2019s very likely going to decide control of the next Congress. Democrats must respond in-kind to any mid-decade partisan gerrymandering.\n\nWhile it\u2019s necessary now for Democratic states to match the conniving of Republicans for any semblance of a fair House of Representatives to remain, this tit-for-tat redistricting must end, and our country must move toward a totally different way of drawing voting maps. \n\nThere is a right way to run a democracy. Look at what happened in North Carolina. \n\nIn 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court took up the job of drawing congressional districts for our state after NC Republicans proved unwilling to draw fair maps. The court drew a fair map with seven Republican seats, six Democratic seats plus one GOP-leaning district that could have gone either way. I won that 50/50 seat by three points and went to Washington to solve problems and work across the aisle like my constituents \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and Independents \u2014 elected me to do. \n\nThat\u2019s how Democracy should look \u2014 a playing field that\u2019s fair and competitive. \n\nUnfortunately in that same year, Democrats lost our majority on the NC Supreme Court, and Republicans in our state legislature quickly proceeded to hack our democracy with zero checks from the new GOP majority on our court. Republicans gerrymandered our state once again, and flipped three seats from blue to red before a single voter had a chance to cast a ballot. Those three seats were just enough to give Trump control of Congress. \n\nTo fix the chaos and confusion in Washington we need more districts that look exactly like the old 13th District that sent me to Washington. \n\nSadly less than 10% of all congressional districts fall into that category. Thanks to gerrymandering we really only have about 40 out of 435 House seats that could flip in any given election. \n\nIn Congress, I authored the Fair Maps Act. It\u2019s the best solution we have at the federal level. It would force all states to play by the same set of rules by requiring non-partisan independent redistricting commissions in every state. The experts at Duke told us that if my bill became law we\u2019d go from around 40 to over 80 competitive seats in Congress. That would be a game changer. Plus the mid-decade maps they cooked up in Texas would clearly be illegal.\n\nMost folks in Washington expect that Democrats will flip the House in the 2026 midterms. Trump\u2019s only hope to keep control of Congress is to cheat. Gerrymandering is brutally effective, and he\u2019s looking to flip as many seats as possible in Texas and other states by drawing new lines rather than by convincing moderate voters that Republicans actually have better ideas. \n\nRepublican extremists don\u2019t want to do the work of fairly winning voters. They\u2019d rather cheat through gerrymandering, and frankly they\u2019ve done a much better job at it. Democrats have been totally screwed by gerrymandering over the past decade. When you count up all the states where extreme partisan gerrymandering exists, you\u2019ll find some districts where Democrats gerrymander, but many more where Republicans gerrymander. The non-partisan Brennan Center has done the math and concluded that Republicans have gained a 16 seat gerrymandering advantage nationwide. If Texas has its way, that number goes above 20 seats. After the 2030 census, when red states like Texas and Florida gain even more seats in Congress, we could expect the Republican gerrymandering advantage to go above 30 seats. That would all but guarantee that Democrats have no real path to a majority ever again with such an uneven playing field. \n\nThere is hope on this issue. We can forever put an end to this mess with legislation forcing the states to draw fair congressional maps. Voters should trust Democrats to deliver on this issue simply because the current system of extreme partisan gerrymandering heavily favors Republicans nationwide. \n\nBlue states will need to match Republican gerrymandering, for the time being, in order to preserve our democracy. If Democrats fail to respond to GOP gerrymandering in Texas then partisan map makers, not voters, will likely hand control of Congress to Trump once again. \n\nFormer Congressman Wiley Nickel represented North Carolina\u2019s 13th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2023 to 2025.",

I wanted to share a cooking hack I discovered recently, well through a series of improvements over time \n\nI have always minced garlic and ginger and kept them frozen for future use, one day I chopped extra onions I had and froze them - time saved on chopping onions and also no teary eyes \n\nA few months ago I realised I had added too much onion to my pan, so I cooked it down, then took out half to freeze for future use - was again super happy with the time save in making my next dish \n\nThis weekend I ended up with way too many onions than I can consume so I decided to to chop them all, and create my masala base, so spent between 45-60 mins saut\u00e9ing my onions, added garlic ginger salt turmeric red chilli powder and cumin coriander powder. Once it cooled down I added them to an ice cube tray and froze (6 onions made about 13 med sized cubes) \nSo today I tested it out, and omg my daal was made in under 15 mins and so so delicious, all I had to do for my base was add two cubes of my frozen masala onions to the pan with low heat (no oil since I used it for the onions), when soft I added some daal masala powder, some lime juice and my chopped tomatoes then my daal which cooked separately in the cooker. Sooo amazed at how fast and how tasty it was! Please try this hack if you\u2019re short on time with cooking or just don\u2019t like standing around for an hour in the kitchen! \n",

After the positive reception to my first hack, Contemporary Emerald, I wanted to finally\u00a0release the other hack I've been making, where I've been trying my hands at using the HeartGold upgrade, hg-engine.\n\nMuch of the community still feels that Gen 4 hacking is miles behind Gen 3, but I wanted to make this hack to showcase some of the features in a tangible and playable way, hopefully leading others to try making some of their own Gen 4 hacks. I introduce:\n\n**HeartGold Generations**, a project featuring Gens 1-9 Pokemon, modern mechanics like nature changing and Mega Evolution, and other QoL features.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i56f5vooobhf1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfe755dad2624f4dd2fb513c8a45e76ea0de8f12\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0at3gcmsobhf1.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60s0obxwobhf1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=169f84d5c63bd0dc76a8e7578ff603a87628a359\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/a5qd0elxobhf1.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pduqi7czobhf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=85aab3c069bc2e330f4adaf4631447feeedf2696\n\n# Features\n\n* **\\~835 Pok\u00e9mon**\u00a0from over 400 families, across **all 9 generations**\u00a0are available\n* All **Trade-Evolutions and Cross-Generation Evolutions** are available\n* Free **Rare Candies** to raise weaker wild pokemon\n* Buyable **Nature Mints** and **Ability Capsules**\n* Free **Heart Scales**\u00a0after 7 Gyms for relearning moves\n* **Level-Cap** in place to prevent overleveling\n* Fully functional **Mega Evolution**\n* Level curve adjusted *slightly*\u00a0to make Gym leaders more relevant\n* Gym Leaders have slightly altered teams to promote more Johto Pok\u00e9mon use\n   * Amount of Pok\u00e9mon and general difficulty/moveset power are identical (Falkner\u2019s Pidgey to Hoothoot for example)\n* Some generic late-game trainers have had their levels boosted to be less irrelevant\n* **Three versions of the hack** for those who prefer different features, Full, Lite, and Vanilla\n* And many more features and changes listed in the documentation in the download!\n\n# Notes (Please Read!)\n\nAll 1025 Pokemon are not available. hg-engine is not fully complete, so a number of pokemon are not catchable. These are mostly legendaries, but some generic pokemon who are dependent on non-implemented abilities (Palafin or Morpeko for example) or pokemon who don\u2019t have sprites at all (Bounsweet or Arctovish for example). This means you cannot complete the full dex, but that\u2019s not the point of this hack.\n\nI went out of my way to make 3 different versions of this hack, because I know people like different things, and there aren't many Gen 4 Johto hacks out there.

This hack won't be perfect, and I'm sure there are many people much more talented than me out there! Because of this, I've decided to make the project open source, meaning anyone can go compile the code and start editing this hack for their own vision. I want this to act as a launchpad for people to start getting more hacks out there, Gen 4 hacking is super streamlined once you get familiar!\n\n[Here is a link to my Github repository ](https://github.com/spearmintz1/hg-engine/tree/HeartGold-Generations-(Full-Version))where you can pull any of the three branches from this project.\n\nAnd finally, [here is a link to the Pokecommunity page ](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-heartgold-generations-v1-0.537551/)where you can download and play **HeartGold Generations!**\n\nSpecial thanks and credits to:\n\n[hg-engine ](https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine)\\- BluRosie  \n[Hacking video tutorials ](https://www.youtube.com/@sauceyaTTa)\\- sauceyaTTa  \n[Custom PokeMart script ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KAGRyS_SgvKkGIDSNWTLFuESmSP5t_N9?usp=sharing)\\- Drayano  \nKingdom of Hacking Discord Channel",

        "selftext": "Hi guys! \n*For title it should be Lasers/Skincare/Beauty Hacks\n*I have tan skin so lasers are a bit complicated due to risk of hyperpigmentation I.e. IPL not mentioned\n\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE double check this with the science, before/afters, own skin and goals, and research articles. I'm not a dermatologist but a majority of my friend circle are physicians and we all do this anyhow before trying anything. I don't have time to cite articles etc and this is just MY experience SO I thought after spending so much money and buying all the overhyped products I should share what worked for me to reduce my skincare regimen and allow me to be makeup free for work. \n\nSo I've been deep into skincare for a long time and I wanted to officially share it as a lot of my friends asked me to. We don't gatekeep here and I thought Reddit would be the best place. My background: I'm into digital portraits and it requires an understanding of good ratios of the face. I'm also into deep diving into skincare hacks like all of us. Here's what I think works off the top of my head.\n\nProcedures\nUltraclear + Coring: forget ponytail facelifts, lip lifts, belphs, skinpinch, brow lifts, etc until you try this first. A good tech can get you the results you want. Ask to core where you want max lift. Make sure they pass with all the levels. It's painful so use your own numbing cream (I think some Russian brands are stronger available online), numb for a long time, and opt for the laughing gas or whatever. Make sure to have them use eye shields for your eyes. Have them core in the direction of the lift you want. Ask for a map of how they did it. \nYou'll want 2-3 over a year to get the full lift you want. Nothing supersedes this procedure. For healing: 10% vinegar soaks + ointment + Benev exosomes + Alastin skin nectar. Hydroquinone to prevent spots from forming. \n\nMoxi Level 3: It works REALLY well but it's a baby compared to Ultraclear. Make sure to try level 3 for maximum lift. You can do a series of 3 if you're not ready for Ultraclear. \n\nFontana 4D: It also works REALLY well and can contour your cheeks skin the buccal fat removal. Moxi Level3/Fontana 4D def made me hot again after 20lb weight loss causing signs of aging before my wedding.  Again do a series of 3 for max results.\nUltraclear did the most though, I would do all 3 until I die or go broke.\n\nBBL Laser: It works and makes you look like you have foundation on (and gets rid of under eye darkness) but because of techs fears of hyperpigmentation (a real fear) it's hard to find someone to do it. \n\nPRF/EZGEL: My under eyes looked better but also the swelling stretched out the skin so it also looks worse? Not worth it. PRF or PRP is useless, the gel is the only thing worth trying. \n\nLaser Hair Removal: Make sure they are using the newest machine that is practically painless, find a center that does a full body membership it's cheaper, you'll need 8-12 sessions. The painless one is worth it just get it done all over at \n\nMorpheus: painful and melts fat stay away. I did it 3 times, it got rid of my beautiful under eye fat pads, it slimmed my buccal fat, and it got rid of some acne though. It's not worth it due to pain and fat melting and lack of skin tightness effects it so claims. \n\nKatalyst EMS Suit >> Emsculpt: They cost the same and both work but you can keep Katalyst for life. Just use settings on abs/butt and get up to level 400,  you can thank me later! I had Emsculpt 5X on butt and AB's, it works temporary, now we own. 2 Katalyst suits and they make sure fit whenever we want and honestly just as fast. \n\nEmsella: Amazing for sex drive and preventing or helping with prolapse issues! Also works for urinary issues post kids :). Do 6 sessions for prevention and amazing sex. \n\nCoolsculpt: Bullshit. Can burn skin btw. \n\nHIFU: Melts fat. But it works:) so use in the right areas. \n\nJ Plasma: feels like lightening bolts attacking skin and limited outcome, stay away. \n\nPDO Threads: Forget it, painful, invasive, temporary. \n\nOmnilux Redlight Mask: Get the MENS version. It works. \n\nJovs: it breaks apparently l but I'm gonna try it and update yall later. Also curious about Amiro devices given what they say they do/tech they use. \n\nZIIP Halo + Silver Gel >Nuface: It works better than all the other main home microcurrent devices I've tried (nuface, medicube, 2 others on amazon) get the silver serum as daily easy skincare. Forget the other ones. \n\nThings on my list:\nSofwave, Emface (per reviews sounds useless?), Syllifirm, Profound, comment and lmk I'll try it if it sounds safe and effective. \n\nInjections: \nBotox: Prevent wrinkles (but tbh this is BS until you have a baby line forming), get rid of wrinkles, shrinks muscle. What I've liked: TMJ/Jaw Slimming (30-50U per side), TRAP TOX (amazing and makes your neck longer), LIP FLIP, NOSE TIP, BROW LIFT (only do the tail of the brow not the whole brow) and PLATYSMA (prevents face sagging and actually works, prob the most underrated and important area for Botox!).\n\nFiller: Deep Lasers (\"lift\" = volume) >> Sculptra (natural body makes volume) >> Slow Down on Fillers >> Injector >> Price/Injectable. Fly to the right person LA, Miami, or New York. Make sure the area they inject, they do often. Treat multiple areas BUT WITH 1/3 THE ACTUAL DOSE you want and go again twice. This prevents the botched look. Dissolve overfilled lips, it hurts, but it's worth it.\n\nALA/Glutathione/Vit C: Shrinks pores and evens out skin tone. Make sure to add ALA for max pore shrinking. It also helps regulate sugar. You can also opt for liposomal. Go to a reputable IV center and make sure to have labs to get ALA. \n\nPeels/SkinCare:\n30%+ Glycolic Acid On Body - Fast way to clear scars and evens out skin tone. Start low and increase slowly to prevent a burn. \n\nTCA Peel - Amazing for anti-aging tbh. But go to a spa and have them do it (face or full body) because it's more serious. \n\nMusely Spot Cream - Amazing stuff if you're lazy like me and don't like to do 100 things. Combines all the stuff you want for face skincare.\n\nApostrophe Triple Cream for Rosacea - Top 3 ingredients that work for rosacea in 1 bottle. Also look into low dose naltrexone. Also moxi or ultraclear helps.\n\nBenev Exosomes + Microneedling: Use for scars and face/body with a home microneedling pen (max the number of needles Dr Pen is good).\n\nCalecium Exosomes + Microneedling: A godsend for hair growth. \n\nRetinol Gel .1% + Stack With Hydration: get it prescribed. Level up to max %, look up how to layer with coconut oil/moisturizers/Benev to prevent the ugly phase (breakouts, dry skin). Don't need if have Musely spot cream or alternate days.\n\nClindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide Compound Cream: Get it prescribed and store it fridge now. It's the only thing that reliably clears up my acne overnight (I've tried dozens of acne products over 16 years). \n\nAlastin Skin Nectar: My main moisturizer post laser. * Wanted to add for Daily I use Prakti Maha mask because it works like under eye filler almost when you stack it on and gets rid of my acne without extra stuff about 60-70% of the time. I combine with Clarins double serum or snail stuff just depends. Also considering plated exosomes.\n\nOurself Lip Plumping: If you don't want lip filler or just want to maximize lip size try this brand it's from the makers of one of the actual fillers and it works.\n\nMinoxidil>Grandelash>Latisse: Latisse darks eyelids /under eyes and lose eye fat so stay away!! It's so hard to get that fat back!! Use castor oil for eyelash durability and oral minoxidil for eyelash growth. \n\nPills:\n\nOral Minoxidil: Max your eyelashes and hair volume\n\nLow Dose Accutane: Freeze eggs before doing this. Derm will prescribe for chronic acne especially if on back etc. It will also help reduce size of tip of nose if issues with rosacea or thick skin. Gets rid of acne but horrible side effects even at a low dose. \n\nSpirinolactone: NOT FOR ME - will give me headache, dehydration, makes me dumb because I'm so dehydrated, worse breakout for months, also just not worth taking this pill. It may work for others?\n\nEyes: Lumify (duh) \n\nHair: Nanoplastia > Keratin Straightening > KBond20 > Olaplex > Dyson \n\nTeeth: SMILE Whitening (in office dental procedure) INSANE will get you white instantly Request for double frequency teeth cleanings Purple Toothpaste = Safe Alternative to Home Teeth Whitening that works better Boka Nanohhydroxy Toothpaste (so you don't loose enamel) Toothbrush with Water Flosser Combined (another lazy girl hack) Therabreath (contains xylitol known to prevent cavities)\n\nMind Hacks: TDCS headband :) works for insomnia, works for mood I'll copy past all my comments into above later I use Elemind headband + Calm Sleep Powder for sleep after having sleep issues - (don't want to take meds, Benadryl is very bad for long term health and linked to increased dementia risk)\n\nMultivitamin: Make sure it has 5 methylfolate not \"folic\" acid. Try pure encapsulations or if you want to eat food-source multi try TEND prenatal bar chocolate flavor. \n\nVit D: Try to get level to 60-90 it's suppose to help with a lot of things including depression!! Alzheimer prevention! Even used by oncologists to decrese cancer risk!! I take 50k unit every week and recheck my level after a month to make sure it's atleast 80. I used to have depression. \n\nAstaxanthin: 2000x more potent antioxidant than Vit C. It can give you an orangish glow if you overuse or if you're aiming for that! I used to use Vit c and other antioxidants. \n\nOmega 3/DHA (fish derived not algae!): Take it or eat fish it's good for you. DHA 1000mg I've been using for 10 years and it makes me smarter and remember more for exams etc.\n\nSilica Drops + Collagen 10G Daily w Hylaronic Acid + 100G Protein Daily > Nutrafol > Biotin/Hair Nail Vitamins: yes the standard female nutrafol works, I prefer Minodixil it's faster and better for me and less big pills lol.  \n\n1G Water A Day - Eat good food, drink water. Take collagen, eat protein 100G daily, fat 50G daily. Otherwise this is useless. ADD POTASSIUM (prime powder packets) to SLIM FACE SWELLING. Add gua sha or lymph suction drainage also to help. Sauna/Ice Water on Face also works. \n\nLow Fat is a FAD - Hit 50G fat a day - obv is you need to optimize weight lower calories and cut inflammatory food like most non vegetable carbs. You can take a food allergy test also and optimize. For example no tomato skins, no onions for us. \n\nExercise (weights good for bones: BUT for brain benefits it's only with aerobic workouts!): increased bdnf and prevents depression also improved blood flow from skin - look into the research and thank me later - you need to burn 1200cal a week to hit this \n\nDairy Does Cause Breakouts - cut it out and see if there's a change for acne \n\nColustrum: ARMRA works better than others but they all work. It's good for gut health aka good for skin.\n\nSeed Probiotic: the best strains here. \n\nRosacea/Autoimmune Skin Stuff: Look into low dose naltrexone and astaxanthin. Autoimmune issues cause the face to look puffy! \n\nPCOS/Hunger Cravings: Inositol 6G powder or gummy inositol/myoinositol Vitamin: Tend Prenatal Bar (hate daily pills) Gummy CoQ10 200mg Tru Niagen NAD+ (gives me energy) OM matcha mushroom powder (this flavor specifically has a blend that makes me happy/laughing next day, I use when stressed) Silica Drops (makes my hair shiny, nails stronger within weeks) Zinc Picolinate 30mg (if sick or acne) Fisetin (or Qualia monthly) gets rid of dead cells I just feel good when I take it Vital Protein Collagen/Hylaronic Acid Dessicated Beef Liver or Shilajit (micronutrients) Multivitamin: Pure Encapsulations ONE\n\nI don't take pills daily except multivitamin or depending on my aim. But these are what work for me and what I've read that makes sense and I've tried without side effects and some benefit x Inpsitol is a miracle that everyone should know about it'll legit make you less anxious too\n\nDeodorant: Chlorella Liquid (removes body odor) > Native > Certaindri. want to try the weekly devices out there that actually stop sweating but weighing risks. Native covers me all day smelling good and I used to sweat through EVERYTHING. \n\nNails: basic - sally hansen hard as nails clear (drop 3-4 magenta drops of any brand in for a natural pink nail look) -  silica drops make nails tough af - only do RUSSIAN manicures they are magic thank me later\n\nSUN: the sun is your enemy for skincare, it's time to be aware of this all the time! Legally UV tint the max of your front car window (there's a way to uv protect without darkening so it's legal). Always wear long sleeves or a hat. Cover face with hand when walking and unprotected. I use supergoop clear sun stick because I'm lazy and it's a stick and doesn't have white caste. I'm sure there's better ones but this is the best clear stick I found. The powder makeup ones are BS and don't actually protect you. A HAT + Long Sleeves >>\n\nWeight Loss: I have a chubby face if my BMI is above 19 genetically. Find the BMI you need for optimizing your face. I drink all my water before eating. I drink black decaf with monk fruit (stevia is not as safe, Splenda is bad news) instead of lattes. I put all\nmy food on a salad instead of rice. I don't eat grain carbs because it makes me bloated. I eat spinach daily because it has highest potassium (reduces face bloating). I try to have have less than 1.5G salt daily. I also make sure there is IODINE in my salt for my thyroid (pink salt is causing iodine deficiencies and thus thyroid issues!). No dairy because it gives me acne (try cashew milk 25 cal). I hit 100G protein via NATURAL NO POWDER sources. Then I sleep by getting my fat intake (50g) and veggies cooked with seasoning I like or whatever I want to eat (kind of a baby Intermittant fast but more lax). If I'm craving sweets I eat frozen fruit and add fake honey (monk fruit sweetened avail sprouts). \n\n\nIf you made it this far, the most important thing is to be at a healthy weight, eat right, drink water, no alcohol (I've heard from friends: Passion flower extract \"anxiety\" > IV NAD (addiction)), no smoking(I've heard from friends: Chantix > Wellbutrin> Nicotine Patch > Tapering Nicotine Vape ), no all nighters (if insomnia look above TDCS headband elemind > Calm Sleep Powder > Sublingual Melatonin). \n\nThis is all I could think of but I've tried a lot feel free to DM me.\nI've also deep dived into fertility and dementia stuff for friends/family! If you want reccs DM! You can fact check me but I research this stuff just like we all do so you'll find out or realize this is likely the consensus. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The playbook nobody talks about.\n\nLook, I know another \"how I made it\" post... but hear me out.\n\nI see you grinding at 2 AM, wondering if you should dump your last $2k into Google Ads. **Don't.** \n\nI wasted 6 months and $8k on ads before I realized something - as a solo founder, you have superpowers that VC-backed teams don't. Here's exactly how I leveraged them:\n\n## 1. The \"One Person, Everywhere\" Illusion\n\nBig companies need meetings to tweet. You don't. \n\nI literally set up alerts for every keyword related to my niche. Responded to every relevant question on Twitter, Reddit, indie hackers, and random forums within 5 minutes for 6 months straight. People thought I was a team of 10. \n\nReality: Just me with my phone notifications turned up to 11.\n\n## 2. Fuck Your Roadmap\n\nThis one's controversial but...

The Pricing Paradox That Saved My Sanity\n\nOk this sounds insane but I 5x'd my prices overnight. Lost 80% of customers. Doubled my revenue.\n\nBut here's the kicker - higher-paying customers actually need LESS support. My support time went from 20 hours/week to 2. \n\nI'm not joking. The $9/month users will email you about button colors. The $97/month users just want it to work.\n\n## 4. The \"Boring Marketing\" Goldmine\n\nWhile everyone's trying to go viral on TikTok, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote 200 blog posts answering the most boring questions my exact customers Google at 3 PM on a Tuesday. Stuff like \"how to export CSV from [competitor]\" or \"[specific feature] not working fix\"\n\nNow I get ~50 signups/month on complete autopilot. Been steady for 8 months.\n\n## 5. Competitor's Worst Nightmare Strategy\n\nThis is borderline evil but... \n\n- Set up Google alerts for \"[competitor] alternative\"\n- Made a comparison page for every major competitor\n- Hung out in their support forums and helped people (genuinely helped, not spammed)\n- Created guides for migrating FROM their tool\n\n40% of my MRR is competitor refugees. Sorry not sorry.\n\n## The Solo Founder's Actual Edge\n\nYou can't outspend them. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them. \n\nEvery customer knows my name. Every feature request gets a personal Loom video response (even if it's a \"no\"). Every churned user gets a personal email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't know their CTO. You ARE the CTO.\n\n## Why Ads Are a Solo Founder Trap\n\nReal talk - ads need constant feeding. New creatives, split tests, landing page optimization, tracking pixels, attribution windows... \n\nThat's literally a full-time job. You know what you should be doing instead? Building shit that compounds while you sleep.\n\n## My Actual Daily Stack (Total cost: $0)\n\nMorning (30 min):\n- Check Reddit/Twitter mentions, respond to everything\n- Record 2-3 personalized Loom onboardings for new signups\n\nAfternoon:\n- One customer call (they book directly via Cal.com)\n- Ship one thing (even if tiny)\n\nEvening:\n- Write one piece of content (blog, tweet thread, whatever)\n\nThat's it. No fancy automation. No virtual assistants. No growth hacks.\n\n## The Plot Twist\n\nI still surf every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. I take weekends completely off. I went to Japan for 3 weeks and revenue went UP.\n\nBecause sustainable > scalable when you're solo.\n\nYou don't need to work 100 hour weeks. You need to work on the RIGHT things for 20-30 focused hours.\n\n---\n\nLook, I'm not saying this works for everyone. B2B SaaS is different from consumer apps. But if you're a solo founder selling to SMBs or prosumers, this shit works.\n\nThe best part? When VCs eventually come knocking (and they will), you can tell them to fuck off because you don't need them.\n\n**EDIT:** Holy shit this blew up. My DMs are cooked but I'm trying to respond to everyone. Solo founders gotta stick together \ud83e\udd1d",

He made what looked like blondie or peanut butter squares, that were made from the flour that was filtered out of the fry oil.  We filtered the oil every night. There was always a layer of cooked flour and we would toss it out.  Like clock work one person would grab one and take a bite and then spit it out.  \n\nFast forward 10 years.  I am now working in sales/customer service at large cable/internet company. We had about 300 people total in this office and I worked second shift. There were maybe 50 people on this shift. Every night someone would take my food. I wanted to teach them a lesson, first I wanted to make brownies with laxative baked in, my room mates stopped me and said why if the person get really sick or harmed. They might fire you. So that\u2019s when it hit me.  The fry oil blondes!  \nI went up to the store to get the things I needed to make Hooters style wings. I think we made 30 or 40 wings that night in my little table top fryer.  I let the oil cool down a bit and started to filter the oil to make my blondies. \nThe next night I took them to work. My desk was close to the break room where the refrigerator was.  Two hours in to my shift I found out who was the thief. It was one of the quality service managers, she was hacking and spitting all over the floor demanding to know who tried to poison her.  I could not control my laughter, she saw me and when to my manager.  He took me in to an office and asked what I thought was funny.  When I explained to him what I had done. He was trying to stay professional but cracked.  After he found out it was not poison, and she had brought this on herself. He told me to go back to work.

        "title": "I am leaving my husband\u2026and he has had an epiphany.",
        "selftext": "my husband and I have been together for 8 years, married for four. I recently almost a month ago asked him for a separation. We have had some amazing moments, but we have had some awful moments throughout these 8 years. My largest issue was his inability to better himself individually. I have three children from a previous marriage and he has four, I've only ever met the oldest two. The younger two kids mother, and him had a huge falling out before I came into the picture, and he has no contact with them. Our family has struggled financially throughout the years, I have worked two jobs three times, just recently last year I worked two full time jobs for 8 months straight to help our family. The money was great, but the strenuous schedule broke me down. He\u2019s never been the romantic, or emotional type. We do not have intimacy, and I accepted that very early on in the relationship that, that was something I wouldn\u2019t receive\u2026.but I told myself I loved him so I would deal with it.\n\nOutside of that, he has had six instances throughout our relationship where I have caught him texting/sexting with other women. Most recently last year I had a feeling, and hacked into his computer, and found EVERYTHING. Him messaging tons of women on social media telling them he was in California and to \u201changout\u201d, when he should\u2019ve been focusing on his dying father. Him sending explicit photos and receiving photos from other woman. Him talking to a coworker, and her telling him he needs to stop flirting with all the girls at work. I never had proof he was ever physical with anyone, but it hurt the same.\n\nEver since then I started to resign from the relationship. My heart had taken a beating, and my love started to fade. I was tired of being the bread winner, cooking, cleaning, organizing and paying the bills, planning everything. While he helped out here and there when the kids needed to get picked up from school early, or had appointments, and I couldn\u2019t go because I was working. He had for the most part always held down a job, but he paid child support so he couldn\u2019t help much with the household bills, and he refused to get a better job because \u201cchild support\u201c would take it.\n\nI was exhausted, mentally and emotionally drained, overwhelmed, And I gave up. I gave up on us, I gave up on him.\n\nNow that I have asked for a separation, he tells me he has been doing work to better himself in his mind for years, and that he had an epiphany, and wants to give me everything I\u2019ve wanted and asked for. He wants us to work on our marriage. He says I\u2019m his everything, his world, and that even though he never physically showed it, he has always loved me so much. In the three weeks since I\u2019ve asked to split, he has found a second job, found a school to obtain his GED, wants to find a better job. All things I have asked from him for YEARS. He says he wants to give me \u201ceverything I\u2019ve wanted\u201d. He\u2019s recently been angry that for the past three weeks he\u2019s been \u201cgiving his all\u201d and I have not reciprocated.\n\nthe problem is I feel it\u2019s too late\u2026.I am exhausted, tired, and drained. I have nothing left to give him. I have held our family on my back for years. I worked two jobs while obtaining my bachelors Degree. I have provided, supported, and poured into him for years while constantly dealing with what he calls a \u201cproblem\u201c with his talking to other women. He wants to do couples therapy now, after I have asked him at least four times previously to do it and he refused saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t work\u201d. And now, NOW, when I am walking out the door he says he has had an epiphany and is a changed man.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m losing my mind\u2026why wait until I\u2019m walking out the door to change?",

Link to their original comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/7QQmTOkiIF\n\nTheir original comment didn\u2019t get much attention (only 26 upvotes at time of typing this post) so I wanted to make this post in the hopes that more people will see it.\n\nTheir full comment (in case you don\u2019t want to click the link):\n\n\u201cIt was about creating a \"perfect\" version of severance where the innie not only doesn't experience their outie's memories, but also gets no subconscious bleed through of their emotions, and more than that doesn't experience any undesirable emotions at all.\n\nSo the reason for the crib disassembly trauma trigger is that even though an innie is never going to be consciously bothered by their outie's trauma, they can still be subconsciously affected by the emotions (e.g. Petey says that iMark still experiences some of oMark's sadness in the office, he just doesn't know why). So the implication is that without refinement, Cold Harbor Gemma would be triggered and slowed down by seeing the crib, she just wouldn't know why.\n\nAnd the broader reason is that even disregarding specific contextual emotions from her outie, Cold Harbor's refinement also prevented the new Gemma innie from experiencing instinctive, universal emotions that would hinder her from completing her task. She's not particularly phased by the discovery that she has no idea who she is, she doesn't lash out at the mysterious voice ordering her around, and she doesn't question the purpose of the crib disassembly work or ask what's in it for her. She just calmly and methodically gets on with it. Compare and contrast Helly R being woken up for the first time. A \"standard\" innie requires heavy conditioning and management to make them compliant and productive, a whole propaganda structure to make their life seem fair. A perfectly refined test innie requires none of that, they're the perfect slave out of the box.\n\nThe big picture is that Cold Harbor's success would pave the way for Lumon to make the severance chip a huge commercial product. As long as they can use the test innie's patterns as a template for automating the refinement process, everyone can just get the procedure to put any boring or traumatic task they have to go through onto a dedicated innie. With no need to deal with the messiness and ethical discomfort of having to psychologically break and crush the human spirit of the innie - because they will come pre-broken.\n\nA more minor aspect of Cold Harbor is that it also proves that none of the personality hacking prevented test Gemma from accessing her common skills or knowledge. She still instinctively knows exactly how to disassemble the crib. Therefore anyone using the severance chip for commercial slavery would be assured that their innies wouldn't need to be trained to cook or clean or whatever, they'd only need to be given the direction.\u201d\n\nIn regards to u/The_PwnUltimate\u2019s point \u201cShe's not particularly phased by the discovery that she has no idea who she is, she doesn't lash out at the mysterious voice ordering her around, and she doesn't question the purpose of the crib disassembly work or ask what's in it for her. She just calmly and methodically gets on with it. Compare and contrast Helly R being woken up for the first time.\u201d, I just want to add that iMark also acted very similarly to Helly upon waking up for the first time, as he threaten to kill Petey as soon as he was able to get out of the conference room.

For example, I toss clothes straight into the washer when I take them off. When it's full, I just run it. Hangling clothes saves me from folding/ironing too.\n\nLet smart appliances handle daily tasks. Dirty dishes go right into the dishwasher, no piles up in the sink. My deebot x9 runs at night, which actually motivates me to keep the floors clear. I barely have to think about the floor now, can't live without it.\n\nClean while you use things. A quick wipe while cooking means way less mess later. It's a good tip, but I can only follow it like 80% of the time though. I find it hard to focus on serveral things at a time. So I could definitely use some more tips here!\n\nWhat's your best cleaning hacks? ",

But with the price of oil down 40% in last 3 months of 2018, one of the main drivers of expensive flights is off the table.\n* **Worldwide economic slowdown is bad in general but probably good for airfare.** Many economists are predicting slower economic growth in 2019 and 2020. When times are tight, discretionary spending like vacations are one of the first items on a family's budget chopping block. Lower demand for plane seats will force the airlines to cut fares in an attempt to woo those travelers back.\n* **Hawaii flights are going to get even cheaper.** Southwest is set to imminently begin flying from the mainland US to Hawaii (and between Hawaiian islands). Other airlines like Alaska, United, and American have already been dropping their fares in anticipation, but I expect that trend to continue even more in 2019. Plus with free checked bags and free changes/cancellations, many flyers will find Southwest's Hawaii flights especially valuable.\n* **Mistake fares will continue.** Mistake fares are when an airline or online travel agency like Expedia or Orbitz accidentally offers fares that are *significantly* lower than normal. For instance, the $130 nonstop roundtrip flight from NYC to Milan that jumpstarted my career in cheap flights. Though not common, they show no signs of abating and should give flyers more opportunities at rare deals in 2019.\n\n*Proof I\u2019m me:* [https://imgur.com/a/ArdEc4k](https://imgur.com/a/ArdEc4k)\n\n*Proof I\u2019m a cheap flight expert:* Recent media coverage from [AFAR Magazine](https://www.afar.com/magazine/the-addicting-cheap-flights-newsletter-you-need-to-subscribe-to-right-now), the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/the-frugal-travelers-essential-list-of-budget-travel-hacks/2018/08/01/7f43e210-9048-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html?utm_term=.191b5e62fe9c), [Conde Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/flight-deal-us-to-europe-from-368-round-trip), [Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/08/207760/how-to-find-cheap-flights-deals), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandratalty/2018/12/14/four-last-minute-flights-under-500-for-new-years-eve-2019/#414365a1680b), [McSweeney\u2019s](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/scotts-expensive-flights-the-airfare-newsletter-for-terrible-travelers) (in a way) and [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a25396330/how-to-get-cheap-flights/) (don\u2019t judge cheap flights are big in the tool community)\n\nWe send out deals departing every country; here\u2019s some of the best flights we found in 2018:\n\n* SFO / LAX to Asia in \\*business class\\* for [\\~$600](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-16-biz-class-mistake-fare-asia-600s-rt-no-bag-fees-sep-mar-aec1b1536) roundtrip (normally $3,000+)\n* NYC to Paris / Barcelona / Madrid for [$292](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/09-25-mistake-fare-nyc-to-paris-barcelona-madrid-200s-rt-bags-extra-nov-mar-64dcbcb09) nonstop roundtrip (normally $850+)\n* Chicago / Dallas / Philly to the US Virgin Islands for [$78](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-14-mistake-fare-us-virgin-islands-68-to-192-rt-bags-extra-aug-jul-ae93a5f3b) roundtrip (normally $550+)\n* Portland to Tokyo for [$377](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/09-04-mistake-fare-pdx-to-tokyo-377-rt-no-bag-fees-jan-mar-37bb2ac27) roundtrip (normally $1,000+)\n* London to the Cook Islands for [\u00a3428](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/06-12-london-to-cook-islands-new-zealand-for-40-extra-428-return-no-bag-fees-nov-d46fc5355) return (normally \u00a31,400)\n* Switzerland to Shanghai for [\u20ac165](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/08-20-cities-added-mistake-fare-basel-geneva-to-shanghai-100s-return-no-bag-fees-227f9f3fa) return (normally \u20ac550)\n* Australia to SE Asia and Hawaii under [$300 AUD](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/10-24-australia-to-nz-southeast-asia-hawaii-100s-300s-return-bags-extra-02ac24257) return (normally $700+)\n* Toronto to the Azores for [$473](https://app.scottscheapflights.com/deals/2018/11-26-toronto-to-the-azores-473-cad-rt-no-bag-fees-dec-apr-78785e80b) CAD nonstop roundtrip (normally $1,100)\n\nP.S.

There's millions of jobs out there, I can easily get a job at a place that actually let's me track my hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSECOND EDIT: Some people are saying that I'm overreacting, and I understand their position. I genuinely do. However, I have about 2 years of experience in the fast food industry, and I have witnessed FAR TOO MUCH bullshit to trust them. Why risk wasting 30 hours of time that I will NEVER GET BACK for a company that can't guarantee me a paycheck? Especially when I can go across the street and apply elsewhere in less than an hour. There are millions of jobs available, so if you can't guarantee me a paycheck, I will literally just leave and go elsewhere. You know why I don't trust fast food? Here's some things I've either experienced firsthand or witnessed\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-A coworker being shorted roughly $300. Our payment system was hacked by China, so our paychecks were delayed 2-3 weeks. My coworker needed that money ASAP to afford rent, so Burger King paid him in cash. Sounds nice, except for the fact that they shorted him in a major way and never paid him the difference that he was rightfully owed. He essentially worked 3-4 days for free for a multi-billion dollar company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Same coworker was denied overtime despite working more than 40 hours. Again, this equates to working for free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Same coworker was upgraded to shift leader, yet they refused to increase his pay like they promised they would. So, he had increased responsibilities for the same pay as a normal crew member. Again, this equates to working for free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-I have been sexually harassed by a manager before. This man (Who happened to be gay, I am also a man) repeatedly called me \"baby\", \"my love\", etc etc. He also repeatedly told me that he loved me, that he was going to break my heart, and that I wasn't allowed to break up with him. This was a daily occurrence and was creepy as fuck. I told my shift leader about it and she told me not to report him because he would get fired if I did. In hindsight, I definitely should have reported him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Same manager intentionally clocked one of my coworkers out and had him work for free. This man would literally go over to the computer, clock my coworker (Whose name was Alex) out, and then just have him perform cleaning duties for free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-I have witnessed numerous health and safety standards being violated, such as swarms of flies in the kitchen, cooks making food without gloves, and buns being dropped on the floor only to be served to customers anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-One time I had a manager who told us to serve chicken even if we dropped it on the floor. One of the higherups saw us doing that, and talked to the store manager about it. The store manager then denied any and all responsibility and blamed his crew members for it, then gave us a warning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-One guy used to clock in, wash the dishes for 15 minutes, and then LITERALLY GO TO SLEEP for 4 hours, leaving me to do all the work by myself. He also physically assaulted the guy at the drive thru window, punching and shoving him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-One of my managers used to steal from the cash register. This put me and my coworkers at risk of being blamed for theft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-I was once scheduled to work at Walmart from 10-6 on consecutive days. I was also employed by Jack in the Box at the time. The store manger asked me to perform an overnight shift in between these shifts at Walmart. I told him that if I performed the shift, I would be operating on TWO FREAKING DAYS WITHOUT ANY SLEEP. The manager said he needed me that night and that I wasn't allowed to go home. So I made myself a sandwich, and left the store. The store manager then texted me asking if I was coming back. I ignored the texts and blocked his number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Oh, and here's a bonus for all of you! I once worked for a landscaping company. This company promised increased pay to anyone who worked in the winter months. My friend was never given the increased pay he was promised. He called the company out on this, and was promptly fired on the spot. This same company shorted me $179 on my last paycheck and didn't pay me until 9 months later when I asked for my W2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I absolutely do not trust these fast food restaurants whatsoever, and I am not risking wasting ONE MORE SECOND of my life working for free. 60 seconds I spend working for free are 60 seconds that I will NEVER GET BACK, let alone numerous hours working for free. I am not about to piss away the precious and little time I have on earth working for free. And again, I live in an urban area with dozens of places hiring within a half mile radius from my apartment. I know my worth and can do better than a job that won't even let me track my hours. That's free market capitalism for you",

Did you guys know you can put rice or whatever grain in your rice cooker with the proper amount of water and then just put cut up vegetables on top and cook it all together? You don't even have to choose a temperature you just press the on button \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude29 It takes like 20 minutes, saves so many dirty dishes, covers a ton of the nutrients you need, and the only other thing I have to do is prepare a protein. Which is often just cold tofu... and then I make a little sauce with soy sauce, chilli oil, seasame oil, rice wine vinegar, seasame seeds, and green onions, maybe add some kimchi and seaweeed, and then I'm done. I'm amazed and extremely grateful so I hope this can help anyone else who accidentally starves themselves because cooking is so overwhelming. You can make big batches to last days too.\n\nBtw i got my rice cooker at Marshalls for like $20 if you dont have one",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nCooking at home in Nairobi doesn\u2019t always have to be expensive, stressful or a hassle. Over the years, I\u2019ve picked up a few tricks in the kitchen that save money, time and stress \u2014 thought I\u2019d share some of the most useful ones:\n\n**1. Keep cockroaches away naturally**   \nMix equal parts sugar and baking soda, then sprinkle in corners and behind cabinets. The sugar attracts them, the soda does the rest. Cheap, safe and effective.\n\n**2. Don\u2019t overspend on cookware \ud83c\udf72**  \nYou don\u2019t always need Carrefour prices. Kamukunji has great affordable kitchenware \u2014 just check for heavy bottoms on pots and non-wobbly handles for durability.\n\n**3. Save cooking gas \ud83d\udca8**  \nAlways cover your sufuria when boiling. It cuts cooking time and gas usage by almost half.\n\n**4. Meal prep = stress-free weekdays \ud83e\udd57**  \nPick one day to batch-cook basics like rice, beans, pasta, or chapati. Store in airtight containers \u2014 it saves you hours during the week.\n\n**5. Cut oil use without losing flavor \ud83c\udf5b**  \nPan-fry with a splash of water before adding oil, especially with onions. The flavor develops the same, but you use half the oil.\n\nCooking doesn\u2019t have to feel like punishment \u2014 just a few hacks make all the difference.\n\nWould love to hear what other tricks people here use at home!",

        "selftext": "I SPOIL THE FATE OF A CHARACTER BELOW\n\nWhat a slap in the face, I am shocked and appalled. The writing was on the wall this entire time if you really think about it. I will admit we had about two  or three missions that really stood out. That open combat garbage tho? If this is the direction of campaign going forward this is officially the death of CoD. Feels like all they care about is focusing on developing a new warzone map and shoving every experience into it. \n\nWHY DID WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN VERDANSK? In the originals we were in Russia, Brazil, the US, Dubai. ALL AROUND THE GLOBE. THIS ENTIRE game felt like it took place on warzone maps. This \u2018open combat\u2019 structure, which was an obvious marketing ploy is worst than I anticipated. NO AI comrades, NO music, Everyone was just in my ear for emotional support? LOL and WTF did they do to Soap?! easily dispatched like a true NPC in prob the most forgettable death of the \u2018new\u2019 universe so far. Soap just entered the story in last years entry. I knew someone had to die cause no way we were about to get that Avengers BS two games in a row, but him out of all characters felt cheap. I wanted a REAL arc with this modern iteration of Soap. New Soap had nothing on Captain Mactavish from MW2009. After playing as him in Cod 4 He had risen to Price\u2019s position by Mw2 and had his own men (Roach,Ghost,etc) EVEN SAVED PRICE in the Gulag. This game is an absolute joke in comparison. WHO is writing this garbage?! Also, WHY ARE WE PLAYING AS PRICE EVERY MISSION?! completely ruining the novelty behind it. Back in the day if you took control of Price you knew something was about to go down. Here it\u2019s just reduced to another DMZ exercise with shit stealth, armor plates and self revives \n\nAlso, WTF are these boring objectives?! HACK 4 PHONES ON THE GROUND AND EXFIL? LOL I was shocked that these were considered \u2018campaign missions\u2019. Feels like something they sprinkle into warzone for FREE at the start of a season in an attempt to say they added missions to the experience but for a CAMPAIGN?! Are you kidding me?!  \n\nIt somehow gets worse when you [read this](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/sep/12/how-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-was-written) and realize SHG started working on this the same time as MW22, yet Cold War was cooked up in the middle of Covid, had less time in Treyarch hands (allegedly) but turns out to be a better game in almost every way LOL. It\u2019s unacceptable, we know it can be done properly but corners are being cut to an extreme. The story seriously felt like planned drip feed content for Warzone\u2019s open world that was instead dropped all at once with a few ACTUAL missions to be considered a \u2018campaign\u2019 and justify $70. It felt very \u2018live service\u2019 caliber if that makes sense, it\u2019s hilariously overpriced. \n\nI really thought this game was going to redeem the low stakes garbage of Mw22s campaign but I was sadly mistaken, it somehow makes that story look like a masterpiece in comparison. Warzone is single handedly ruining every corner of the CoD franchise. There is no way someone can tell me this wasn\u2019t planned as DLC. A bad one at that. I have been with this series since CoD4 and have played every campaign minus WW2 and Vanguard and this is without a doubt the worst campaign I have ever played. No passion to be found. Just WARZONE assets LOL ",

No mods, no resource packs, survival on hard difficulty, ~~latest release~~ any full release version after 1.16.

        "selftext": "ETA: This is a really long post! Personally I love hearing other people's stories and having lengthy discussions. If you hate that and just want the summary, here's the TLDR first. These are nine of my personal favorite \"life hacks\"\u2014tell us yours!\n\n1) A study found that people given lab coats performed better on tests: look smart, feel smart. Use this principle to stay motivated at home by dressing like a bitch who gets shit done instead of wearing sweatpants around the house. \n\n2) If you know how to sew, stick your sewing machine in your laundry room and just fix / hem / take in garments immediately after washing. Don't tell yourself that you'll get to a tailor eventually and then miss out on wearing your favorite pieces. Having the machine handy keeps your wardrobe fresh.\n\n3) Upgrade your shopping bags to totes with extra long, *padded* handles so you can comfortably throw all your groceries on one shoulder instead of hands or elbows.\n\n4) If your house has a lot of stairs, do yourself a favor and get a dedicated handheld vacuum. There's no reason to be dragging the upright or canister up the stairs every single time you vacuum them.\n\n5) Unless you're already a ceiling fan person, grab a cute desktop fan and bring it with you room to room. The breeze feels nicer than AC anyway and lets you stop blasting the entire house with frigid climate control. This switch saved me $130+ on my monthly electric bill.\n\n6) If your phone is constantly beeping with text notifications, but you can't silence it in case the text is from a boss or colleague, take 15 minutes to individually assign your work contacts a loud text notification, then put your general text notification as Silent. That way, when your phone beeps at work, you know you're supposed to look at it.\n\n7) If you're struggling to find the right eyeshadow shade for a glowy, minimal look, your favorite blush or bronzer might be it.\n\n8) This one probably doesn't apply if you have kids. Otherwise, don't wait till after dinner to put the leftovers into tupperware and refrigerate them. Put your serving onto your plate and immediately refrigerate any leftovers before you sit down to eat. Reduces the temptation to go back for seconds when you're already full.\n\n9) If you're someone who sleeps through alarms, try light instead of sound. Put a bright lamp on your nightstand and plug it into a wall-plug timer.\n\nAnd now for the insatiable readers and chatty bitches :)\n\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcheswithtaste/s/NaVymmtRh2) excellent recent post got me thinking about my personal life hacks: simple things I wish somebody had told me to start doing a decade ago that have made my life easier with minimal effort. Not all of mine are free, so they don't belong in the previous discussion, but they were all less than $100. Some of them are just a matter of changing my attitude.\n\nI want to hear not just your secret life hacks, but also the success stories behind them. It can be just as hard to start a good habit as it is to break a bad habit, and for me, it's so much easier when I can envision the end goal.\n\nEven if it seems way too obvious, please share anyway! Sometimes the answer to a problem is staring you in the face and you still can't see it.\n\nHere are the low-effort, high-reward tricks I wish I'd learned ages ago:\n\n*Motivated bitches with no dirty dishes*\n\nI used to come home, rip off my work clothes, ditch the bra, and slip into something super comfy\u2014sweatpants, worn-out tee, ancient oversized hoodie, mismatched fuzzy socks. And then I'd maybe watch some TV, grumble my way through \"chores\" like dishes and laundry, lounge around, go to bed.\n\nOne day about six months ago, my husband (also wearing sweats) made the offhand comment that we must be slobs, because whenever our neighbors step outside to check the mail or something, they are at least wearing jeans and a properly fitting tee. I got to wondering whether we are the outliers and everyone else really is at home dressed like a sitcom character instead of walking around in pajamas.\n\nSo I tried it the other way, partially out of pure curiosity and partially because I couldn't get the word \"slob\" out of my head. I'd come home, take off my work clothes, and put on some nice jeans, cute top, maybe a necklace or bracelet.\n\nIs THIS how you unstoppable bitches have been doing it this whole time?! Wearing my nice jeans, I wouldn't dare crawl into bed for some Netflix, so I found myself wandering the house looking for something to do. Washing the dishes or vacuuming seemed easy and obvious. If I needed to run to the grocery store, I didn't dread it because I was already dressed for it.\n\nI feel like a completely different person just because I started dressing up as one. Turns out this is a real thing, it's called \"enrobed cognition,\" and I was the last one to get the memo.\n\n*Your own personal tailor... someone to mend your tears, hemmin' your flares*\n\nI used to ruin my life with clothing. While folding laundry, if I noticed something damaged or just thought to myself that it didn't suit me anymore, I'd hang it up in the back of the closet and promise to deal with it soon. Of course that never happened and I would find myself with a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear. So I'd impulse buy something new and the cycle continued.\n\nMeanwhile, my sewing machine sat in the closet, only to be pulled out if I want to make a garment for a special occasion or if I bought new curtains that need hemming.\n\nRecently I started tackling the project of decluttering my closet and curating my wardrobe, and I took out my sewing machine and set it up on the end of my laundry folding table. Now, if I find a pair of jeans with one of the belt loops ripped off, or a dress hem coming undone, I just toss in the correct color thread and fix it right then and there. Takes five minutes.\n\nIf the issue is more time consuming than that, like a pair of pants that fit better 10 pounds ago, or are a bit too long now that I'm in my ankle pants era, I put them in a designated basket next to the sewing machine and come back to them that weekend.\n\nMy clothes fit better, I feel more stylish and less wasteful, and I don't feel the need to buy new clothes because I actually enjoy wearing the ones already in my closet.\n\nApparently this is ALSO a thing\u2014\"shopping your own closet\"\u2014and once again, I missed the memo.\n\nBonus round on this one: I've also discovered how cheap and easy it is to dye clothing. Now that I know my best colors, I hate to wear anything that just makes me look blah. Why wear grey ever again when I could absolutely glow in cobalt?\n\nBut not everything comes in cobalt, coral, and emerald, and I already have otherwise flattering sweaters and dresses in colors that wash me out. Takes me half an hour with a big pot on the stove and a $6 bottle of Rit Dye to get the exact color I want.\n\nYou don't even have to start with white. Recently I bought a super cute sweater on clearance but it only came in pink. I wanted coral. Threw in a few drops of yellow dye, and now I've added a coral sweater to my Bright Spring capsule wardrobe!\n\n*One-trip wonder*\n\nGrocery shopping is a pain in my ass.\n\nBut I upgraded from my retro-stripe Aldi reusable grocery bags to a few sturdy canvas totes with extra long, \u2728padded\u2728 handles. Now instead of carrying all my grocery bags in my hands or on my elbow, I can comfortably throw them all on my shoulder and still have both hands free for my keys or phone.\n\nIt also dawned on me that grocery totes don't have to be just literally for the grocery store. I bring them in on every shopping trip now, like at the hardware store or liquor store, and solve the same problem when I'm buying paint, wood glue, or car parts...\n\nSimple light bulb moment but it took me long enough.\n\n*Cleanliness and meowiness*\n\nWe have two cats. Constant vacuuming is not optional. I dread vacuuming the stairs, dragging my stupid upright vac with me\u2014so of course the stairs seem to be where the cat hair accumulates fastest.\n\nI finally did myself a favor and spent $89 on one of those little handheld pet vacuums. Now I just do the stairs with that in 90 seconds every day and save the upright for everything else.\n\nAs a bonus, the handheld vac is perfect for detailing your car.\n\n*Some Hate it Hot*\n\nI have saved a fortune on electricity during this heat wave. I used to just blast the climate control throughout the whole house and get hit with a $300+ electric bill. Shame on me, I know.\n\nThis year I'm just bringing a 10-inch desktop fan with me from room to room. The breeze feels cooler than the AC anyway, and my electric bill is more like $170.\n\nWhen a fan isn't enough, I use the zone settings on the climate control and keeping it a few degrees warmer than I used to. In most of the house I don't run the AC at all, just in our bedroom and bathroom because we both can't sleep when it's hot.\n\n*Unbothered*\n\nI have to keep my phone on me at work in case my boss or colleagues call or text me, but it also looks unprofessional to be constantly checking my phone. I used to just silence my notifications so that I'm not looking at it every time it beeps, because the majority of beeps are from friends and family. Instead I'd glance at it every half hour or so to see if I have a work text.\n\nEvery once in a while I will check it and find out that somebody texted me about something relatively urgent and is now annoyed that I haven't replied for 20 minutes. Sure, they could have called, but is anybody still doing that in 2025?\n\nSo I finally set aside a few minutes and manually gave all my work contacts a loud text tone, then set everyone else on silent. Now I know for a fact that if my phone beeps, I'm supposed to look at it. And when I'm at home, I can reply to friends or family on my own time, when I want to look at my phone, instead of hearing a beep and feeling the pressure to respond instantly.\n\n*You're making me blush*\n\nI've wasted hundreds of dollars trying to find the perfect eyeshadow to achieve that minimal, glowy, barely-there natural makeup. Everything that works on other people seems to be too dark or too dull or too brown. I have spent hours Googling \"no makeup looks for fair skin\" and \"clear spring natural makeup palette\" just to find the same unflattering recommendations.\n\nRemember I said coral is one of my best colors? I've been barking up the wrong tree.\n\nPeachy-coral blush is my perfect eyeshadow, and it brings out the green in my eyes.\n\nIf you have a blush or bronzer that really makes you glow, it's probably also a candidate for a subtle smokey eye. You can skip the liner, dab it on with your fingers, and tone it down with your blender.\n\n*Lead us not into temptation*\n\nI used to cook dinner, put food on my plate, and leave the pan on the stovetop or in the oven. Then I'd wander back to the stove, take another little plateful, eat that, feel way too full, and waddle back to put the leftovers in the fridge.\n\nMy new and improved routine: if eating alone, like when my husband is working late, I mindfully put food on my plate with the intention of being satisfied but not stuffed, and immediately put all the rest into a tupperware and stick it in the fridge. Empty pan goes right into the dishwasher before I even sit down to eat. When he gets home, he can take it out of the fridge to reheat.\n\nIf we're eating together, I fix a plate for each of us and I know he will want seconds, so I leave exactly enough in the pan for his portion, then immediately tupperware and refrigerate the rest.\n\nIf it's not right there in my line of sight, still hot and way too convenient, it takes away my temptation to go back and keep grazing. I feel so much better in the evenings when I'm not feeling full and bloated after dinner.\n\nBonus on this one: breaking news, feeling full and bloated every evening is terrible for your sex life. The tupperware trick is also a relationship hack.\n\n*Get lit*\n\nI've always had to wake up at 5 am for work. I have also managed to sleep through a tornado touching down half a mile from my house, so you can imagine how easy it is for me to sleep through even the loudest alarm. So embarrassing.\n\nOn some trip years ago, I got on the plane and immediately fell asleep after takeoff like I always do, and then woke up instantly when they turned the cabin lights back on before landing. I realized I always wake up when the lights come on.\n\nSo I ditched the alarm clock and put a crazy bright lamp on my nightstand, then plugged it into a wall-plug timer. Never overslept my alarm again. Career blosssomed.\n\n...if you got through all of these, congratulations. I hope they inspire you to live your best life in good health and good taste.\n\nNow tell the rest of us bitches your own overnight success stories and lightbulb moments.",

If I miss something that you want added, leave a comment, I will add it to the OP. \n\nAlso I will try to keep these tips as spoiler free as possible.  \n\nMake sure to check back often as I will be adding tips!\n\nEDIT: This thread blew up faster than I thought with alot of great tips being added. I will read through the comments tomorrow and help people where I can and update the list with more tips\n\nEDIT2: I will also be making a fallout 4 survival lets play now that I have the hang of the game make sure to subscribe [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/user/dylloop)\n\n\n**General**\n\n- Sell Fusion Cores to traders before they run out, you will get much more for a partially charged core, over an empty core.\n- Pickpocket enemies with power armor to steal their Fusion Cores, this will cause them to leave the armor, and you can steal the frame\n- The Lone Wanderer perk still provides bonuses with Dog Meat as a companion\n- When Leaving your power armor remove the Fusion Core so no one will decide to use it.\n- When hacking look for [],(), <>,and {} with anything in between the brackets, clicking the leftmost bracket will reset your attempts to give you more tries, or remove dud words from the list.\n- Try to always carry a weapon of each ammo type, that way you are less likely to be completely out of ammo.\n- Some companions can pick locks and hack terminals for you. More specifically: [Cait for lockpicking, Nick Valentine for hacking](/spoiler)\n- You can tag specific crafting materials by going into your junk section in your inventory, and switch to material view.\n- There is no level cap. Don't fret about spending perk points. The game's enemies don't scale with you, but they do get harder farther from the start, and the farthest away points of the map have level 50 enemies. There's no shortage of things to take down and no shortage of points to get strong enough to do it.\n- To force a companion to equip, or apparel switch to their inventory in the trade menu, and a button will show up to have the npc equip the item. ( \"T\" for PC, \"Y\" for Xbox, \"Triangle\" for PS4)\n- For Power Armor: sprinting, strong melee attacks and VATs drain your Fusion Core faster than walking or standing still.\n- Fast Travel in Power Armor doesn't use and Fusion Core battery, and you can still fast travel with no charge in the core.\n- You can zoom in on the pip boy by right clicking.\n\n**Crafting**\n\n- You do not need to break down junk items to get components by hand the game will do it for you if the junk items are stored in your settlement workbench or inventory. Extra resources will be deposited in your settlement workbench.(It may take some time to appear)\n- You can grow your own adhesive by cooking Vegetable Starch with Corn, Tato, Muttfruit, and Purified Water.\n- When naming weapons, put a hyphen or space at the beginning of the name (EX: -gun name), and those weapons will default to the top of the list in your pip-boy.(Thanks: [CromeDaBeast](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3sgwpn/psa_when_naming_weapons_put_a_hyphen_at_the/))\n- If you look at the Junk section of your inventory you can switch to a list of all the components your junk breaks down into (with C on PC). In that list you can set or remove a search tag.\n- When you upgrade a weapon, the current mod will be placed in your inventory. If you transfer all mods to your workbench, if you put that upgrade on another weapon, it will use the mod before crafting a new one.\n- You can salvage weapon sights by modifying the weapon with the no sights attachment, which costs no resources to make.\n- If a gun/armour has a mod you can't build, you can still swap the mod out and install it on another weapon.\n\n**Settlements**\n\n- When building settlements you can raise and lower objects by holding E and using scroll wheel on PC, X and L1/R1 on PS4\n- When building your first settlement use E to move the initial workbenches instead of scrapping them.\n- You can remove the radiation from Starlight Drive by scrapping the barrels in the center, and the Unrusted Crashed Car.\n- Water pumps, farms, and traders deposit the Items and Caps they produce into the workbench.\n- To help place objects in hard places use a small rug then place the object on the rug, pick up the rug and the item will remain attached but the game uses the rugs collision detection.(This allows you to clip objects into walls!)\n- To assign settlers select them in the crafting screen then select the object you want them to work\n- Settlers can work up to 6 Food at a time. Meaning a settler can tend to 12 plants that produce .5 food each.\n- To reduce raider attacks make sure your defense state is higher than food + water.\n- Highlighting a settler in workshop mode will also highlight anything he's assigned to.\n- Fast Travel in between settlements will instantly grow all crops that have a settler assigned to them.\n- When your selecting something through the workshop build interface if you press and hold the move command(Press and hold [E]) this will pickup all items attached(or very close) to the object you are picking up. (Be careful as if your walls are all attached you can pickup very large parts of your settlement!)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m [25/M]. I started dating this girl [22/F], it\u2019s only been 3-4 months, but ALOT has happened since then.\n\nShe has a sister [18/F] and her sister has a boyfriend [21/M]  who have been together for 6 months. When I first met her sister and her sister bf,  I thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. My gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes I think it was too much. \n\nLittle by little I started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. In the beginning I felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but I always thought \u201cmaybe I\u2019m trippin, that\u2019s just how they are, it\u2019s nothing\u201d and left it alone. \n\nThen more weird shit happened. \nLike one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. Nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. It was weird to me bc she tells me that they\u2019re like a brother and sister. Brothers and sisters don\u2019t dance that way. I ignored that situation and kept it moving.\n\nAnother time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. So he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. They switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  The weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and I asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. A picture says a thousand words. While my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. She posted that pic but deleted it after I said it was weird and people kept asking her \u201cwho\u2019s the lucky guy\u201d .  At this moment I was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. \n\nAs time went on and my gf and I got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. Every time i would Hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, I\u2019d feel the hate in his eyes.  He\u2019d mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her \u201cfamily\u201d (him and her sister). He would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. When my  gf would say no, he\u2019d get angry. \n\nIt got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. Everything was all good. I wasn\u2019t there yet but when I arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. It was like that the rest of the night. \n\nWhen they left, I finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. We had a long talk about that situation and other things. At first she didn\u2019t see things that way I seen them but started to put two and two together. She didn\u2019t want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. She was not convinced But agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she\u2019ll be a little less friendly.  \n\nAt this time it was 10am, we still hadn\u2019t slept. Her phone made the notification noise. I looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: \u201cLets fuck\u201d \n\nAt this moment, we\u2019re both in shock. I grabbed the phone and showed her the DM. \n\nIt was from her sisters boyfriend. \n\nHer:  \u201cmaybe that\u2019s them playing around\u201d \nMe: \u201cyou don\u2019t play around like that\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cit could have been my sister writing that\u201d\nMe: \u201cokay then, if that\u2019s what you think, let\u2019s                  call. If you\u2019re sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. If she sounds like she\u2019s just waking up, it wasn\u2019t her playing games. But if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he\u2019ll go.\u201d\nHer: \u201cokay\u201d\n\nMy GF calls, Her sister answers, in a groggy voice. Like she had just woken up.\n\nGF: \u201chey what are you doing?\u201d\nSister: \u201cI was sleeping what\u2019s up\u201d\nGF: \u201cWhere\u2019s your BF?\u201d\nSister: \u201che\u2019s laying next to me\u201d\nGF: \u201clook at what he just sent me\u201d\nHer sister hangs up. \n\nWe call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.\n\nWhen We call back, gf sister answers. In the background, we can hear that they were arguing. A few seconds later, she hangs up and we don\u2019t hear from her again for the rest of the day.\n\n\nA few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. Idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. My gf believed him, but still had her doubts. I in the other hand, don\u2019t believe it for various reasons. \n\nMy gf and I spoke about it things and she said that she\u2019ll keep her distance. Either way I let it go and decided to move on. He would continue to come around but it wasn\u2019t the same. \n\n\nFew days went by. \n\nYesterday, I call her to talk and see how her day is going. She picks up, crying. She says she\u2019s at her sisters house. Her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn\u2019t breathe. I tell her to call me back asap. \n\nTime went by and I call to see what\u2019s going on. She picks up, i ask her what happened. She says she\u2019s home, her sister is doing fine, she\u2019s at the hospital with her parents. \n\nMe: \u201chow come you aren\u2019t at the hospital with her also?\u201d\nHer: \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and I was hungry so we left. \nMe: \u201cwho are you with?\u201d\nHer: \u201cMy sisters boyfriend, I told him to come instead of waiting there. \u201c\n\nAt this moment, I am bothered and disappointed. After all that we\u2019ve been through, You\u2019re alone, in a house, with someone that you know I don\u2019t feel comfortable with. That\u2019s what I wanted to say, but did not say it bc I was on speaker. \n\nSo we continue to talk while she starts to cook. There comes a point where her phone dies. I give her 8-10mins to call me back. (Takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). She doesn\u2019t call, so I call her. No answer. I wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. I wait longer than 5mins this time and call. She picks up and says her phone died. \n\nMe: \u201chow come you didn\u2019t call back after it died?\u201d (She usually does right away)\nHer: \u201cI was on the phone with my sister, she\u2019s ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride\u201d\nMe: \u201coh\u201d\n\nHer sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. My girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. \n\nShe calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. We talk about the situation, and I patiently wait for them to leave so I can talk to my gf about how I felt bothered that she was there alone with him. \n\nWhen they finally leave, I express myself to her and tell her how I felt. From that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. \n\n- She says that  I have no right to feel the way I felt. That\u2019s her \u201cbrother in law\u201d.  And that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.\n\nI tell her, that I do have the right to feel bothered. It might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. I feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. Being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d like to know what you guys think.  Am I overreacting? Or do i have a point. \n\nAm I the only one that thinks it\u2019s weird?  What would you do in my shoes? \n\n",

        "title": "[Gordon Ramsaydom] \u2018Are You A Better Cook Than A Fifth Grader?\u2019 or how Gordon Ramsay failed at making a meal for children twice",
        "selftext": "Hi! First post on the new account. (No, you can\u2019t know the old one.) Normally, this is where I\u2019d say buckle in, but this one is short and sweet. It\u2019s a ride, just a ride down the road for some milk, you know?\n\n##The First Sin\n\nAlright, so: When Gordon Ramsay, celebrity chef and restaurateur, was shooting for *Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted*, his crew realized they were short on footage, and this shortly after visiting an Australian cheesemaker. Gordon\u2019s tired. He\u2019s jetlagged. If you ask me, he\u2019s possibly hungover.\n\nIn a random house in the Tasmanian countryside, no grocery store for miles, he thoughtlessly throws together some video material to fill the air. He has no kitchen equipment, just a wood fireplace, and a cast-iron skillet. He has no ingredients, just a hard loaf and some artisan aged cheeses.\n\nBut the show must, regrettably, go on.\n\nHe makes the only thing he realistically can, a grilled cheese.\n\nHe slices the hunks of cheese as best he can, two kinds of fine, aged stuff. He slices the bread as thin as it will allow, which is about an inch wide. The poor guy is doing his best; he personally salts the butter. And because he can\u2019t help but be bougie, he adds some kimchi.\n\nHe does everything as right as he can. He doubles up on fat to crisp the exterior, oil in the pan and butter on the bread. But he still makes mistakes. The fireplace blazes hot. He\u2019s visibly sweating. In his exhaustion, he didn\u2019t even think to oppose the two cheeses so you get both kinds in each bite.\n\nIt\u2019s all to no avail. The bread is burnt, and the cheeses, fats locked in over months or years, have not cooperated. (Culinary nerds will know that aged cheeses melt very poorly, and when they do, the fat and oil just splits and oozes away.)\n\nAnd because he\u2019s in presenter mode, he\u2019s forced to talk up his mistakes. You know how he talks about making everything? \u2018Beautiful\u2019? \u2018Gorgeous\u2019? \u2018Delicious\u2019? That\u2019s how he\u2019s talking about this sandwich as he cuts [the world\u2019s saddest cross-section.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fx6mtptm568g51.png%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df8439c3b76125355f610be5d8abe8cbb63355ae1)\n\nDon\u2019t look away. Go back to that link. Look at it. Look at what he was forced to make. This alone would hurt any chef\u2019s pride. But Ramsay isn\u2019t just any chef. He\u2019s a public figure, and this was *content*. Which means the internet gets to judge him.\n\n##The Shame\n\nImmediately, this video trends for all the worst reasons. Uploaded in 2020, it has since accumulated 5.4 million views. (\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, ShooHonker!\u201d That\u2019s because people are sharing sad screencaps and dunking on him in comments, not watching him!)\n\nAnd you have to admit, it\u2019s a little funny. I mean, if you\u2019re a random netizen and you hear that Gordon Goddamn Ramsay made that sandwich, it\u2019s bound to be good fun to pretend he had every reason to do it right and just couldn\u2019t.\n\n[People are saying he\u2019d shit on this if it was served to him, people are saying he made it because he\u2019s out of touch with the common man.](https://imgur.com/a/2C4W9Ph) -isms are tossed around, mainly classism. Here is the bourgeoisie manifest, fame and riches so alienating that even a man born in the working class can\u2019t make a meal for children! And the ego! He dares call this beautiful?\n\nAnd for years in the wake of this, he\u2019s getting tagged. Every time you cook a scrumptious cheese sam, and you want it to reach more people, just add a dunk on the most high-profile chef in the world and guffaw. \u201cThis was so simple!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t believe you couldn\u2019t make this right!\u201d \u201cPut me on Iron Chef instead!\u201d [Tom Brady](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/tom-brady-making-a-grilled-cheese) even gets in on it.\n\n[A man can only take so much.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GCtes4TWMAABux_.jpg)\n\n##The Double-Dip\n\nTime to take the trolls to task. Gordon is shooting in Southern California, in a public square for a live audience. You just *know* he\u2019s itching to deliver this rejoinder, but he\u2019s not being bitter. The vibe is more that he\u2019s just eager to prove himself.\n\nThis time, he\u2019s pulled out all the stops. He has a special-built cooking stage, with a logo of the word \u2018idiot\u2019 in a sandwich lit in neon on the front, a classic reference to the defining moment on Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nHe makes his own jalapeno jam. He sears mushrooms. He makes a chutney sauce. He cuts fine Italian country bread, and it\u2019s actually cooperating with his knife. Aged hard cheeses? Nay: Gruy\u00e8re, cheddar, and taleggio, all either soft or young. And, of course, braised shortrib, seared to perfection.\n\nHere it is! The glory! What a redemption! At last, Gordon Ramsay has proven all the haters wrong, and demonstrated that he can in fact make [a delectable and gorgeous vegetable and shortrib melt.](https://imgur.com/a/YlE71jd)\n\n***Wait.***\n\n##The Spirit of u/Fuck_Blue_Shells, Sandwich Reaver\n\n*That\u2019s not grilled cheese.* That\u2019s a melt! **HE DIDN\u2019T MAKE A GRILLED CHEESE!** Sound the alarms! He said he\u2019d make grilled cheese, and he made a melt! There\u2019s other ingredients besides bread and cheese!\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the consensus opinion. It\u2019s undeniably a competent sandwich. \u201cWell done Gordon,\u201d we all say, \u201cWould. That said, [is the grilled cheese coming after this one?](https://imgur.com/a/0jQpmsC)\u201d\n\nNaturally, the new sandwich trends again amongst those of us following Ramsay\u2019s toddler food arc. No reply has come out, not even a year later. People are still mocking him, too, but at least they're doing it in a more light, teasing way.

        "selftext": "# TL;DR\n\n# My wife and I sold everything we owned in 2021 except our tiny backpacks and worked from hotels for 3 years in 27 countries spending < $3k per month each. We travel hacked 3.5 million points for free business class flights and almost 1000 nights in 4/5-star Marriotts and Hyatts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8fbxo5kxahwe1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d9e1db448625c3ff5e2a9f3c14aec0a9c5c0e5e\n\nWe earned the highest-tier statuses which gave us free upgrades to luxury suites, along with free daily breakfast, access to lounges with snacks and drinks, daily housekeeping, gym, pool, sauna, spa, etc.\u00a0We haven\u2019t had to clean our rooms,\u00a0change our bed sheets,\u00a0or take out the trash in years.\n\nIn this post I'll share some of the hacks and tricks we figured out along the way that led to us spending even less money per year than we did before we started traveling!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjtvu8bd4iue1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1cddf2ea2d2a5847fd321064e5d0d3172b1a23c\n\nThis is a collage of some of the places we visited including Machu Picchu (Peru), the Taj Mahal (India) where we got engaged, Chichen Itza (Mexico), Hagia Sophia (Turkey), Mount Fuji (Japan), Eiffel Tower (Paris), Cusco (Peru), Cappadocia (Turkey), Blue Lagoon (Iceland), Marrakesh (Morocco), and Miyajima (Japan). See daily stories on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dan7geo) for proof.\n\n# Hacking Hotels\n\nLiving in hotels full-time quickly earned us the highest tier statuses at Marriott and Hyatt (in combination with their credit cards). Living in 4/5 star hotels cost us on average less than $150 per night over the last 3 years. In expensive cities, we sometimes paid $200 to $400, while in cheaper cities it was often less than $100 per night.\n\nWe earned roughly 16% back in hotel points (for example, 17.5x Marriott points with Titanium status), 6% back in credit card points, and 2-3% back by clicking through Rakuten to book. This was about 25% back per dollar of hotel spend.\n\nSo essentially, we pay only for 8 months of rent and get 2 months free with these points. We don\u2019t have to pay rent for the remaining 2 months per year since we spent 3-4 weeks at work conferences and 5-6 weeks visiting our families.\n\nTherefore, our total cost for accommodation in an entire year was approximately 8 \\*30\\*150 = $36,000 per year, which translates to an average of $3000 per month i.e $1500 per person.\n\nWe used to pay the same $3000 monthly rent when we lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City. But on top of that $36,000 yearly rent plus extra for utilities, we had to pay double for hotels during the 2-3 weeks we went on vacation! So it was actually cheaper for us to live in hotels full-time all year.\n\n# Hacking Credit Cards\n\nWe earned an extra 100,000 points every two months as signup bonuses by opening new credit cards and charging all these hotels to meet the spending criteria. We ended up cycling through over 20 cards combined earning 3.5 million points cashing it out for about $100,000 worth of hotels and business class flights.\n\nWe thought this would make our credit score go down but it actually went up to over 800. Whenever possible, we downgraded each card to a free version without annual fees after exactly one year, instead of canceling (so that it doesn\u2019t affect our credit score much).\n\nSome of the US cards each of us have cycled through include Amex Platinum, Gold, Green, Capital One Venture and Venture X, Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve, Citi Premier, and Bilt. We also got a few hotel credit cards, including those from Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton, and some airlines cards.\n\nDoctor of Credit is the best resource for credit card signup bonuses by the way (the other websites sometimes prioritize their affiliate links over the best deals)\n\n# Onebag Setup\n\nAfter 3 years of optimization, everything I owned consisted of just 34 items that cost under $1700 USD in total, weighing less than 11 pounds, and fit in a tiny 10L onebag. (My wife added her 16-pound onebag setup in another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1k12tj8/her_version_16pound_onebag_couple_3_years_27/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6pwr7t9b4iue1.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=db2327cf1bac6612157b85bb80e5b1bae4a61c25\n\nI\u2019ve listed each item along with their cost and weight here: [https://lighterpack.com/e/r08kbs](https://lighterpack.com/r/r08kbs)\n\n# Tips\n\n**Traveling**: We used most of the points we earned through those signup bonuses to fly business class on all the long-haul flights (7+ hours). Usually, we book short flights (or trains) and slowly hop to nearby countries and cities to minimize jet lag.\n\n**Local Transportation**: We use Uber or public transportation (which is typically very good outside the US). We also like to book day trips and guided tours, with good ratings on GetYourGuide or TripAdvisor, to see attractions that we would otherwise have to drive to.\n\n**Insurance**: A lot of these credit cards cover travel insurance and medical emergencies while you\u2019re traveling abroad. Healthcare is also cheap in most countries other than the US.\n\n**Paying for stuff**: Make sure to use credit cards which don\u2019t charge foreign transaction fees when making purchases abroad. Almost every country takes Visa and Mastercard credit cards at stores and restaurants, so we have rarely needed any physical cash.\n\n**Getting cash**: Never use foreign currency exchanges since they always rip you off by marking up the exchange rate by 5% or more. The best way to get local currency is to use either the Charles Schwab or Fidelity debit cards to withdraw cash directly from any ATM anywhere in the world. These debit cards don\u2019t charge any currency conversion fees and they refund you all the fees and surcharges (usually $5 to $10) that ATM providers charge.\n\n**Avoid DCC**: If given the choice to pay in US dollars (or whatever is your home currency) and the local currency of the country you\u2019re currently visiting, pick the local currency. Never choose to pay in US dollars (or your home currency) when abroad or you\u2019ll end up paying 7% extra for Dynamic Currency Conversion.\n\n# Food\n\nWe went to almost 2000 restaurants in 3 years! We got the free hotel breakfasts and then ate out every lunch and dinner at restaurants. This costs us on average about $1000 per person per month. In the most expensive cities like New York and Geneva it cost up to $2000 but in other countries like India it cost less than $500 (since an average meal was less than $10 per person!)\n\nEven before we started traveling, we used to eat out or order Uber Eats every day since neither of us can cook. So by traveling we got to experience incredible authentic cuisines from all over the world!\n\nHere's a collage of some of the amazing food we\u2019ve had recently in Peru, Colombia, Japan, Turkey, India, United States, Mexico, Iceland, Italy, England, Scotland, France, and Morocco.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrqa63is4iue1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bda8308da507b4a93ebb4fa79aaa9f4686eff70\n\n# Total Yearly Expenses\n\nOur combined yearly expenses including everything was roughly $70,000 i.e. $35,000 per person per year.\u00a0\n\n**Monthly breakdown**: The average expenses **per person** per month was roughly $1500 for rent, $1000 for food, and \\~$400 for all other things (like Ubers, shopping, phone bill, tours, etc.)\n\n# Working Remotely\n\nBoth of us were AI research scientists (we met at Google and started dating right before Covid). We quit Google and got fully remote jobs before we started traveling in 2021. We worked New York-hours remotely during weekdays and explore the cities in the evenings (or mornings depending on time zone) and weekends. We mostly moved hotels only during weekends or holidays. When we traveled to places with extreme time zone differences like Japan, we used all our vacation days.\n\n# Settling Down\n\nWe started out thinking we\u2019ll travel for just a few months and then settle down in another apartment. But it was so much fun and not as exhausting as we thought it would be so we kept on traveling for 3 years and enjoyed every minute of it. Of all the countries we\u2019ve visited, our favorite ones were Japan (both of us agree it\u2019s number 1 by far), Peru, Sri Lanka, Iceland, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.\n\nFinally after 3 years, I had saved enough for financial independence and wanted to start my own company, so we moved back to San Francisco (since it's the best place for startups). I had hacked together an AI tool that listened in on all my meetings and automated a lot of my work while traveling, so I built the startup around that. But there are still miles to go before we stop!\n\n# Questions? AMA\n\nFeel free to ask anything below!\n\n# Edit: FAQs\n\nMany questions are being asked multiple times, so I'm compiling my responses here:\n\n**How do you survive with just 3 t-shirts?**  \nI hand washed laundry every few days in the hotel sink. All my clothes are merino wool (stays odorless) or other synthetic materials that dry fast. The hotel hair dryer helps in an emergency.\n\n**How do you deal with cold weather?**  \nI layer multiple merino wool shirts with the Uniqlo heat tech underwear and the ultralight down jacket. We don\u2019t like extreme cold weather so usually hop to warm places in the winter.\n\n**Is this really worth the time and effort?**  \nI spent about 1-2 hours per week booking hotels and flights and churning cards (to get the $100k value over 3 years). After the steep learning curve, it becomes quick and easy. We simply focus on just one card every 2 months, put all our combined expenses on it to quickly hit the minimum spend, freeze it, move on to the next card, and use up all those points within 2-3 months.\n\n**What about taxes and work visas?**  \nI got a short-term work visa in the UK and got digital nomad visas in the EU and many other counties (exempt from local taxes). We spent less than 1 month in most countries. I reported our daily location to the tax lawyer provided by my employer and filed taxes correctly. I refused to apply for a green card, so I became a non-resident in the US and UK by traveling so much that I saved a lot of taxes and retired early (FIREd) at 29.\n\n**What about data and 2FA?**  \nWe got a T-Mobile family plan ($45/month/person) that provided free roaming and 4G/5G data in 200+ countries.\n\n**How do you receive mail and new credit cards?**  \nFamily member in the US sent us photos, then we added the cards to Apple Pay.\n\n**Didn't you run out of credit cards?**  \nHaving a \"player 2\" doubles the available cards. With some small 1099 income you can also get the business variants. Even with 20 cards, we haven't made it halfway through the best bonuses listed on doctorofcredit. Except the Amex cards, you can get most bonuses again every 3-4 years.\n\n**Were there any safety issues?**  \nI grew up in India until 21 so I was used to traveling in third-word countries. My wife didn't feel safe walking by herself in Morocco, Egypt, and certain parts of East London but all the other places felt very safe. TBH we had worse experiences in downtown San Francisco and Seattle.\n\n**What about all the different clothes in the photos?**  \nThe photos were taken over a span of 3+ years (got new clothes and jackets every year or so). We got the suit and dress for a friend's wedding and went to the Taj Mahal right after the wedding and got the engagement photo.\n\n**Did you miss having friends and community?**  \nDuring COVID, most of our friends had moved away and we had just started dating, so the timing worked well, it felt like a 3-year honeymoon! We stayed with family twice each year, and visited many old friends who live around the world. On many trips we got different sets of friends and family to join us.\n\n**Did you ever get tired of traveling?**  \nWe actually tried settling down in NYC midway but after 3 months in one apartment, we both couldn\u2019t wait to travel again! The only reason we moved back is because Silicon Valley has the best ecosystem of investors, talent density, and founder peers so I was able to raise millions more at a higher valuation and hire an incredible team including 2 former Google coworkers as co-founders. Ironically, I want everyone to work in-person now since it makes a huge difference for an early-stage startup.\n\n**Is this fake?**  \nNo, you can Google \u201cDaniel George Insider\u201d to find articles published by Business Insider after interviewing us and verifying receipts of hotels, flights, expenses, and income over 3 years.",

My front door opens and I figured it was one of my in-laws, they don\u2019t usually drop by unexpectedly but Angie and MIL (totally forgot the fake name I assigned to her) both have a key to my house since they help me out so much, it\u2019s just easier that way. Imagine my surprise when I\u2019m chopping up carrots to see Jess waltz into my kitchen. I simply pointed the knife at the door and told her to get the hell out of my house before I called the cops and pressed charges for breaking and entering and trespassing. I wasn\u2019t concerned with how she got into my house (I keep my doors locked 24/7, call it paranoia if you will) I just wanted her out and would figure the rest out later. She started screaming bloody murder and was calling me \u201cpsycho\u201d for threatening her with a knife. Jake heard the screams and rushed inside. His immediate response was to restrain Jess because he thought she was hurting me even though there was a solid 10-15ft between us. He dragged her out of the house and told her to leave. She was screaming that she would ruin my life and all she was coming over to do was ask for forgiveness. Well she called the cops on us and made up this elaborate story about how we lured her to my house to set her up, how I tried to stab her, and Jake was punching her repeatedly. She had zero proof and I have cameras hitting every angle of the outside of my house and in all of the main rooms in the inside of my house. Naturally I just pulled up the footage and showed the cops and they left, taking her with them. Jake has spent the night at my house every night since then. Since then she has hacked into every single last one of my social media accounts, including Reddit. She posted some truly awful and hateful things on my Facebook and instagram. I\u2019m thankful she didn\u2019t manage to post anything on Reddit before I got it back. She spammed my job, I\u2019m a nurse at our local hospital, with complaints and some truly awful fabricated stories about me. After a week of suspension to investigate I was welcomed back after everything I told my boss and my boss\u2019s boss, HR, and everyone else above me proved to be true. I filed for a restraining order against her and my children when she tried to pick up my oldest from her school without anyone\u2019s knowledge. Thankfully I already had a talk with the school about this and gave them a strict \u201conly these people can pick up my child, everyone else you send away, call the cops, or whatever you need to do\u201d when Tyler got violent in front of the kids awhile back, and they escorted her off school grounds and kept her very close by for pick up until they saw me. Right now I got an emergency order approved but will have to go to court for a more permanent one within the next month. So I will let you know how that goes. She must have had a key from when we were growing up together or something because Angie and her husband have not spoken to her nor has she had access to them or their home. I got the locks changed immediately. \n\n\nThe Tyler update is that there is none. He still hasn\u2019t reached out to see his kids, hasn\u2019t asked about them. He\u2019s been a ghost. We were eating dinner with Jake about a week ago when my oldest quietly said she wished Jake was her dad, and that her real dad never played with them and was really mean when I wasn\u2019t home or looking. Which really just confirmed my fears, they were too accepting of him being gone and now I know why. I did learn through the grape vine (MIL and FIL) that he is already remarried and has another kid on the way. MIL told me they got a baby shower and wedding invite in the mail. Honestly, I feel bad for the new wife. \n\n\nThe kids are truly just wonderful. Still in therapy, but the therapist has nothing but positive things to say after their sessions now. She did mention that my oldest brought up calling Jake dad, but I\u2019ll be honest I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready for that. Jake has made it clear that once (yes he said once, not if, but once) we\u2019re married he fully intends to adopt the kids, but that is another conversation for another day haha. I don\u2019t want to deter her from having a bond with him, but it still feels too soon you know? My middle child seems to have forgotten Tyler completely and is my usual ray of sunshine. I\u2019ve seriously never met a happier kid. The baby is babbling away, smiling, and laughing now. Can yall believe it?? I\u2019m truly blessed with such wonderful kids.\n\n\nJake. Well Jake is Jake, you know how that goes haha. No seriously, I have never felt such happiness before. He was genuinely concerned at how many people were commenting asking if we were still together and told me \u201cyou better update right now and tell them we\u2019re still together\u201d \ud83d\ude02 I wish you guys could hear just how funny he truly is. I officially allowed him to give me the title of girlfriend, though he says I\u2019ve been his girlfriend practically this whole time haha. He has been sleeping over essentially every night, he says it\u2019s under the guise of being worried Jess might show back up, but secretly I think it\u2019s because he hates being away from the kids. Whenever he\u2019s at work or anywhere that isn\u2019t my house he will text whoever is with the kids asking for picture updates of them and expresses how much he misses them. It\u2019s actually really sweet. He\u2019s been allowing me to set the pace still, just also helping give me a nudge when I need it. He\u2019s attended a few of my therapy sessions with me to help get a better understanding of what I need from him in terms of this relationship. Jake is honestly just, everything I could\u2019ve asked for. I\u2019m lucky to love him.\n\n\nAs always, thanks for being here. Until next time friends :)",

Please for the love of god stop sending me your nudes man. Consent is key and I didn\u2019t ask for any of that. I\u2019m happy to be able to see this part of Kierstyns life, but a few of you guys are making it incredibly awkward for me. I\u2019m practically a married man, and only am interested in seeing one singular person naked. Thanks!!!"

        "selftext": "I believe I have AFRID although I've never been diagnosed. To make a long story short, I have deep deep rooted anxieties about all things food. I also have a history of disordered eating and crash dieting. I did intuitive eating therapy for 2 years and have mostly recovered from BED now. But the AFRID food anxieties are here to stay forever. \n\nBecause of those things, moderating my food intake in any way is an instant trigger. Both for anxiety and for disordered eating. Then add in the ADHD factor of meal planning and prepping. I hate everything to do with cooking, meal planning, eating...etc. My husband does almost all of the cooking and meal planning. If he even asks me for input it makes me want to curl up and die. If someone offered me a pill to give me all the nutrients I need but I'd never be allowed to eat food again, I'd do it. I wouldn't miss food at all. Not even favorites. That's how much I despise everything that revolves around food. It sucks that it's a non negotiable part of life. 3 times a day. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI honestly could eat snacks for every meal for the rest of my life to alleviate the stress it causes me, but that's not healthy and doesn't work well when you're a mom lol.\n\nI don't want to lose weight necessarily. I am overweight but I've come really far in making peace with where my body is at now. Any type of calorie restriction is an instant setback mentally for me. It sucks. But I do want to try and get some better nutrition in my diet with the least amount of prep and planning I can get away with. I did overnight oats for a while for example and really liked it! I just need to get back into the habit of making them again. Does anyone have any similar hacks to stack up your protein or nutrients with little effort?\n\nThank you in advance! And please be kind. I promise any critique you have about my eating habits and body type and thought process about food and losing weight...I've already said each one to myself at least 5 times today. Like I do every day.",

Any food that requires processing or cooking basically they won't touch. So the stuff never get picked. They take ready to eat meals and deli stuff etc. chips, soda, crackers, pizza etc. What is left (often a ton of food) goes to the volunteers or it's to the trash.\n\nAll the volunteers always end up with perishable things like farm fresh eggs, half & half, steak, chicken, shrimp, boxes of cake mix, meatballs, seasoning etc. I'm cooking up some salmon right now. \n\nYou have to process through the stuff and make sure they're all within date yes but it's really cutting down our grocery bill. \n\nIf you're frugal and have a little time, try to find local food organization and volunteer! Provide services like website building, marketing, design, drivers (very needed!) etc. It offset the grocery bill and it's a win-win.",

The mod team and SATORI squad have received a fantastic amount of love, support, and gratitude for sweeping up the shills, fixing ModMail, providing valuable insights, and otherwise doing our part to keep Superstonk as wonderful as ever. Fan mail, fan art, even a [serenade to our beloved algo-rilla.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgu4e/i_sing_satori_a_song/)\n\nThe appreciation is very much appreciated, but our work is never truly done. More so than ever, the responsibility to maintain a legendary sub rests in the hands of ordinary Apes.\n\n[Satori Dev 2021 Colourized ](https://preview.redd.it/pl2ongc36a471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f8eefbaa05393ea3fa9c425e024687ee361871b)\n\nThe shills are *absolutely furious* about what we've been up to the past week. It's as if they [need this allegedly-impossible creation of ours shut down post-haste](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrx4pu/onslaught_of_antisatori_fud_gives_me_hope/) \\- desperation is in the air, and it tells me everything I need to know.\n\nAs the informatics arms-race between SATORI and its adversaries heats up, I'd like to make everyone aware of emerging stratagems and what they mean for the Ape community, so we're all well-equipped to deal with anything thrown at us ahead of time.\n\n**Solicitations, trolling & phishing in DMs**\n\nThis tactic is as old as FUD itself, but it hasn\u2019t been this prevalent in months - the working theory is that the impostors suddenly have a load of accounts unable to post lying around, and wish to make use of them somehow. So, if you get any suspicious messages pushing \"investment advice\" or similar, **please report these to Reddit and our mod team.**\n\nA lot of these are Meltdown trolls that thrive on the attention, so I wouldn't recommend engaging or 'putting them on blast' - but if you insist, our friends from [r/scambait](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/) have plenty of advice on the matter.\n\n**Bad karma**\n\nSince the restrictions, Apes whose accounts barely make it above the karma limit have [found themselves under attack by bots downvoting all their submissions, pulling them back below the threshold.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsij2i/are_bots_and_shills_down_voting_apes_below_the/)\n\nThink about it - if professional FUD-mongers can't spread FUD directly, the second-worst thing they can do is attack solid content to prevent it from being seen. These attacks are exactly why we set SATORI to run in reverse and approve Apes, as well as using it to gather data on new tricks.\n\nWe're currently in discussions regarding what else can be done to prevent or counter such surreptitious acts; suggestions accepted. For the time being, it's up to everyone to be active in upvoting the good, downvoting the bad, and reporting the *really* bad. Not only does this help a clear sub - it also lets us learn about the shills and strike back more effectively.\n\nAs with $GME as a stock, every vote matters.\n\n**Leveraging Apes and the weekend ennui**\n\nOn Saturday, a lot of us woke up to a *flood* of posts relating to a comment by a particular CNBC reporter. Sharing new info is a wonderful thing, but in this case, it was a deluge of the same content being repeated over and over again. As you can imagine, I was getting a ton of pings asking to sic the Terminators on these guys.\n\nSo, where was SATORI?\n\nAs [Bradduck explained in his ambassadorship comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nplhx7/game_stop/h05v5ec?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Interdiction Day, our setup is currently running on a per-user basis; a bit of negative sentiment doesn't necessarily make a shill. We've all woken up on the wrong side of bed, and one comment isn't enough for anyone to form an accurate verdict - whether they're an algorilla or a carbon-based, 100% organic, dip-buying ape.\n\nWe know that our adversaries are aware of this, and how they're countering it - their only hope at this point is to rely on otherwise well-behaved users to post content that dilutes or otherwise lowers the overall quality of the sub. That, and outright *stealing* accounts with AI approval or Superstonk posting histories in broad daylight - more on that later.\n\nTheir attempts to drag down karma on Apes' accounts reveal that they're just as interested in preventing top-tier submissions from gaining traction as they are indirectly posting their own tosh. So, now that they're mostly unable to bring their own stuff into Superstonk, they're relying on us to do their work for them.\n\nI took the liberty of checking the Melissa posters' accounts, and it turns out the vast majority of them were genuine Apes with solid and lengthy histories in Superstonk. No wonder our per-user security measures didn't bag 'em, they aren't supposed to.\n\nIt's the weekend, there aren't any crayons to watch and everyone's understandably miffed. But please, if you believe the meme/tracker/DFV tweet or similar you're about to submit may have been posted before, I implore you to **check before posting.**\n\nThe Superstonk jungle - especially the [Knights of New](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nti5ms/knights_of_new/) \\- will appreciate it dearly.\n\n**Tag teams**\n\nStruck with a sudden shortage of useable accounts, our adversaries have had to pick their battles a bit more wisely - as opposed to regurgitating the same thing over and over, getting banned, migrating to a new account et cetera. One way to accomplish this is by tag-teaming - setting up a wedge of sorts and sowing drama on both sides.\n\n[Here's a brief yet insightful comment covering this tactic, and how to deal with it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsmutv/complacency_kills_dont_let_satori_lull_you_into_a/h0nk71l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Hacked accounts & a final note on account security**\n\nWe have received a surge in reports of Superstonk users\u2019 accounts getting compromised It would appear that accounts able to post (i.e. approved by SATORI or above the karma/age requirements) are more likely to be targeted, but this could happen to anyone - don\u2019t get complacent.\n\nPlease refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nojpde/best_security_practices_for_protecting_self_and/) for a comprehensive rundown on account security, in addition to other useful advice on the matter. Also, a friendly reminder not to click any [suspicious links.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n[ NO hax for you Kenny ](https://preview.redd.it/awilw5m96a471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b932464d13bfb0760ac89ea49b11f8e0419c9b89)\n\nTA;DR\n\nWhile the sub is significantly cleaner than it used to be, SATORI still has a long way to go. Since deployment, we've seen a trend towards attacks that don't rely on publicly 'revealing' their accounts. The might of 375,000+ AI-assisted gorillas is just too much.\n\nInstead of the old hit-and-run spamming, our foes are resorting to sneakier methods: hacking accounts, manipulating karma, sliding into people's DMs, and otherwise causing trouble outside the public eye. In addition, they're increasingly relying on genuine Apes to accidentally drown out the good stuff, being increasingly unable to bring it into the sub themselves.\n\nThis scenario leaves far more responsibility to individual Apes than what we had before, so it is up to each and every one of us to deal with it appropriately.\n\nA sub is only as strong as its weakest link - B.H.V.F., and be strong.\n\nCatto======================================================\n\nAlso from the Satori Team: \n\n[Important Security Update for June 8th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nva7nh/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important/)\n\n[u/Grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/Grungromp/) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80Help Wanted\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\n\n**If you have any interest in assisting with the Summary/ Transcriptions check out this post from** u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore**:** [**Superstonk Seeking Volunteers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw3s9m/superstonk_seeking_volunteers_ama_transcription/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# LAST MINUTE BREAKING NEWS \n\n[CEO AND CFO ANNOUCEMENT](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-appointments-chief-executive-officer-and) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Reddit down \ud83d\udea8**\n\nWith Reddit having issues during high traffic, exciting moments in this saga, we have discussed what to do if Reddit has an outage.\n\n**IF REDDIT GOES DOWN AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT A LARGE PORTION OF THE MOD TEAM IS ON TWITTER.**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle](https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/u\\_sharkbaitlol](https://twitter.com/u_sharkbaitlol)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BradduckF](https://twitter.com/BradduckF)\n\n**IF THERE IS SOMETHING BIG GOING ON WHILE THE OUTAGE IS HAPPENING WE MAY ALSO UTILIZE THE \"EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM\" TO RELAY INFO:**\n\n[SuperstonkLive YouTube - Emergency Broadcast System](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ***OOK OOK***\n\n***\"I may have been early, but I am not wrong\"***\n\n[\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d](https://preview.redd.it/l6h28q8ds8471.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b27c837a1b1f0e047e3822ee74f63e94e3e5566e)",

        "selftext": "Thankfully my husband and I have lived out of state for most of our 14 years together so we havent had to deal with ignorance from his family on how we live and/or raise our kids. However, my FIL fell ill so we moved back to the states to care for him, as my MIL is far too old and weak to do so herself and her daughters, who live in the state, couldnt be bothered. We have lived right beside them for going on 10 months now.\n\nWe have 9m and 6f children. Both very intelligent, respectful and insanely empathetic. We raised our kids in a way that was completely against how we were raised; which was basically to sit down, shut up and never question a damn thing. My husband and I both had very toxic childhoods and were silenced when it came to everything. Ever since living beside his parents they have attempted to inflict this onto my children.\n\nNow, it started off small. Like, my FIL telling my 9yo that it was HIS duty as the man of the house to pick up an ax/chainsaw to cut the house firewood. Mind you, we do not have a woodstove so my FIL just expected my small child to run outside with a chainsaw and hack up firewood for his house. When I said no, my FIL flipped out on my husband and said I was weakening my son and stripping him of his manly, expected duties. \n\nOr my MIL telling my 6yo that she is old enough to prepare and cook meals for the family. I only found this out a couple weeks ago when I got home from work and found a burn on my daughters forearm from apparently a hot pan she was attempting to take out of the oven. Not only did she burn herself but she also got the fifth degree from my MIL stating that her food was bland and that she needed to \"be better if you ever expect to get married some day\". \n\nAnyways, I went to discuss these matters with my MIL and FIL because I had had it and they weren't listening to my husband. When I arrived they were cross with me and said that they were concerned that my kids were going to grow up to be entitled snowflakes and that I am raising them in such a way that they will never know how to fend for themselves or understand life. I told them that they needed to stop inflicting 50s livelihood onto my children and that under no circumstances will my children be restrained to a toxic lifestyle that people whom they barely know are trying to enforce. They told me to leave. I said gladly.\n\nNow my SILs all the sudden give a damn and have messaged my husband stating that his life has been tarnished by me and that I am destroying what his parents taught him. Independence, apparently and the ability to live without need.\n\nAITA?",
