Whenever I do I try to make more than enough food and put effort into it so everyone has a memorable meal\n\nThis past week my wife's family was having a going away party and I offered to bring some appetizers. Normally I'd spend some time researching and preparing something suitable for the occasion, but with appetizers I always come back to something Tony Bourdain said. I don't have the exact quote, but it was something along the lines of \"No matter how much effort you put into an appetizer, nothing will ever be consumed as quickly as pigs in a blanket\"\n\nAnd every time I try it, he's right. I made some basic pigs in a blanket variations (some with cheese, some with egg wash and bagel seasoning, some with garlic butter) and they were well received. As in, all of them gone well before dinner and everyone complimentary\n\nCrowd pleasing food doesn't have to be hard\n\n[Here's](https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/pigs-in-a-blanket/e8abc84e-8a0e-42d6-ae7e-23b677a161ac) the basic recipe I used.

But I just thought it looked kind of funny. I bought it to use it to make veggie stock. \n\n3. I tried raw red onion the other day in a salad.  I mixed up red cabbage with red onion.

She would proceed to critique all the reasons her pastry \"didn't turn out\" as the whole family gorged on her objectively delicious apple pie.  Sunday after Sunday, it was not enough flour, or too much shortening or too hot in the oven.  When I think of my grandmother who passed away decades ago I think of that apple pie and her pursuit of this venerable pie in the sky.\n\nCooking meals for people creates memories.  People are far more likely to remember the night you made that lasagna in a snow storm and everyone danced on the table to a well placed Al Green song and third bottle of wine.  You'll eat out thousands of times, trust me, it's the dinners in that stick. \n\nI once heard of a grandparent who knew they were dying and filled three deep freezes full of meals that their family ate for years.  Everyone eating a warming bowl of ham and split pea soup long after your gone is a pretty damn awesome legacy if you ask me.\n\nSo why should you learn to cook? Many reasons but near the top is so you can cook for other people.  So that if you are lucky to get old and crotchety you can complain about your pastry as your family appreciates every last bite.\n\nLove you Granny T,\n\n\\-R\n\nPS: What a great food memory you have?

Now at 41, soon to be divorced (not entirely because I don\u2019t cook) I\u2019m realizing that I need to gain some skills to provide my daughters with good healthy food options.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to start. Just this week I burned grilled cheese because I didn\u2019t know how hot to get the pan first.\n\nI\u2019m so ashamed and embarrassed, but can anyone recommend a truly beginners guide for me? One that actually says \u201cheat the pan really hot first\u201d or \u201cmake sure you use butter/cooking spray\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not necessarily worried about quick recipes, but easy, healthy and something kids will enjoy trying.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nUPDATE: Holy cow I didn\u2019t think this would blow up like it did! I took the kids skiing today and my phone was blowing up the entire time. Thank you to everyone who took the time to write a response. This doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be as hard as I thought and I\u2019m actually looking forward to trying some new things this week.\n\nAll of this isn\u2019t to say I haven\u2019t \u201ctried\u201d many times.

If you want to learn to make really good salads, no harm in serving them with some premade frozen meatballs from Costco and your favorite jar of pasta sauce while you make a salad and homemade dressing. If you want to make the pasta, don't be afraid to use a jar of sauce, or vice versa (box pasta with homemade sauce). \n\nMost of your errors at least initially will come because you're not paying attention and doing too many things at once. If you eliminate that and just focus on the steps to achieve one component, eventually that component will become easy enough to do while you also do something else. \n\nOnce upon a time, you couldn't walk, talk, read, write, cook, drive a car, wipe your butt, be trusted to supervise children, or be trusted with any gainful employment. 41 years later and now you presumably can do all those things except cook. Not so bad! You just learned other things for 41 years and will figure out cooking on your 42nd trip around the sun. \ud83e\udd37"

I just enjoy helping others. \n\nLet me explain my intentions a bit more\n\nI was bored one ~~day~~ week, and I decided to write up a list of all essential items that any kitchen should have. This was meant to help beginners who don't have much or any kitchen hardware, or for those who are looking to upgrade their existing hardware. I decided to also include an \"expanded\" and \"expert\" level of hardware that you will eventually need as well (see the separate tabs on the bottom of the spreadsheet). \n\nI hand-compiled 95 items, and used product recommendations from America's Test Kitchen and Serious Eats to come up with three different options for each item, at three different price points. So there are currently 279 individual items with prices and links to purchase. \n\nI feel pretty good with the range of items, I'd say it's about 95% inclusive. If you spot anything I have missed, feel free to let me know and I will add it.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to highlight this great suggestion from /u/BrooklynNewsie\n\n>If someone here is planning to move out of their own, it\u2019s worth printing out a list like this and posting it on the wall of your new kitchen, add a check mark every time you want to use something from the list you don\u2019t have yet. Highlight it if there is no available substitute to get the job done without that tool. (Obviously make sure you have the absolute basics [pan, spatula, knife, cutting board, grater, fire extinguisher]) When you hit 3 check marks, add it to your shopping list.\n\nEdit 2: Wow! So much great feedback, thank you all so much!\n\nI have made a few updates to the spreadsheet; I added a mandatory column, per many of your requests, which is just what is sounds like, things that are absolutely mandatory and you can't live without. \n\nI added some little pictures as well, because why not. \n\nNext I will be adding some descriptions as to why each item is considered essential, or basically why I think it deserves a spot in your kitchen. I will try to keep my bias out of this. \n\nI will also be creating a list of baking essentials as well. Look for that in a new post within the next week or so. \n\nLastly, if any of you still reading this have any software programming experience, I am looking for some assistance setting up a Python script or Visual Basic code, or whatever, that will auto-update the prices from Amazon. I know Java and some C++, but that's it. Please DM me if you would be willing to help!",

        "title": "Hello everyone !! I work in restaurants and want to share some tips to help any cooks that need them .",
        "selftext": "1.]  Use a wet cloth under your cutting board to keep the board from slipping on your table or counter . \n\n2.] Use sharp knives and a proper grip !. This can't be stated enough . Sharp knives save fingers and a dull knife can and will glance off the edge of most produce and won't do very much to cut meats . Meaning you will use WAY more force than you need to cut something and potentially cut yourself, also cuts from dull knives hurt worse .\n\nTo grip  the knife properly it does take practice.  The most common way to hold the knife is to pinch the blade where it meets the handle . This like choking up on a baseball bat , it will give you better control over the blade . It may feel a little funny at first though and depending on the knife / your hand size and physical abilities could take some adjustment, either way though it's a good place to start . \n\nNow i know we have all seen the way chefs grip things when they are cutting . Its lovingly known as    \" The Clawww\"  and it too saves precious fingertips from amputation. Not only does the claw give adequate control it also keeps your fingers tips in while cutting . \n\n*** Too make the claw lay your hand out flat.\n\n*** Now bend  your fingers at the middle knuckle and bring your fingertips towards your palm .\n\n*** This completes the claw look . \n\n*** Now when you go to hold produce or meat you want to try and hide your fingernails on whatever  you are cutting.  This will almost create a little wall with your middle and index knuckles. \n\n***. Now comes time to conquer some fear , place the side of the knife against the wall you have made now  you can cut down where you need to make the size you want or you can slice or chop the same way by using your knuckle wall as a guide while keeping your fingertips safe .It takes time to get used to it and you may end up knicking yourself but its way better than the possible alternatives \n\n*** KEEP practicing!! .Knife skills and proper grip are skills that take time ,but they will help save injury no matter where you are cooking \n\n3.] Get yourself a kitchen thermometer and a chart on safe cooking temperatures . Bacteria and food born illness thrive  in whats called the temperature  danger zone . Luckily refrigeration and cooking kill most of it the unsafe pathogens so as long as we are mindful of how we treat our food we can stay healthy. The FDA has great charts and info on this i suggest reading over some or all of it . \n\nThe second reason too use the thermometer is to control when your food is done or is ready for another step depending on the recipe ; instead of just guessing. \n\n4.] Do not use shakers to salt things . Keep a little bowl of salt by your stove . Remember all salt is not created equal so you may need to play with different types . I almost always use kosher salt except for baking but thats just me . Any how salt shakers don't let you control the salt so it is easier to over indulge instead of just a pinch at at a time \n\n5.] Same goes for pepper . Unless you have a  pepper mill or grinder you already trust then this is also a safe bet . Some folks just make a blend and leave it at that and use it for just about everything . If i do that then i like to do about 75% kosher salt to about 25% black pepper . \n\n6.] Keep dry cotton hand towels handy . One draped over a shoulder or in an apron string . You never know when a mess or spill wil happen or when you may need to pull out a pan from the oven or move the hot one you forgot you sat there oven .They also are great for keeping your knife clean or giving your hand a quick dry for dealing with life stuff.\n\n7.] Do not be afraid to try your mistakes.  Messing up is part of cooking . Sometimes weird things work ..sometimes they make you question everything  you hold sacred. Either way trying them helps develop your pallete over time and will help you to understand what works together and what does not \n\n8.] If you have read this far then then the last thing i will share is HAVE FUN ! Cooking is more than just a way to fuel yourself . It can be a release and a chance to create and share so have fun with it and relax with it when you can . \n\nI hope these tips help and feel free to ask any questions!\n\nEDIT: Holy cow ! Ididnt expect all this love . Thank you all for the awards you are too kind \u2764",

                "body": "Really simple to make. All you need is sushi rice, nori (edible seaweed), vinegar (to drizzle on the rice), and a sushi mat. \n\nYou can use whatever fillings you want. I used lettuce, cucumber, avocado, kewpie mayo and hot sauce, and either salmon (marinated in soy sauce for an hour) or pan-fried chicken thigh (also marinated in soy sauce). I also tried to make tempura prawn but it ended up looking like a lump of charcoal so I didn't use it. If you use raw fish, try to buy ones labelled for sushi making, or at least fish that has been frozen. \n\nLay the nori on the mat (cover the mat with cling wrap so rice doesn't stick), and spread evenly cooked sushi rice that has been drizzled with vinegar. Leave a third from the edge if you want nori on the outside, if you want an inverted sushi with rice on the outside then spread all the way. If you want rice on the outside, flip it over at this point so the nori is facing up. Lay out your fillings in a line about 2cm from the edge, then roll the sushi. The process is shown in the video I've linked below.\n\nYou can find a tutorial on how to roll sushi on youtube, it's very simple. The part that can be tricky is not letting the mat get rolled up in the sushi. I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/Hgiu9cqph5Y?t=221), ignore how fancy Jun's sushi is."

Through all of it, the most important thing that you learn is that everyone has different tastes and taste buds.  You don't cook it for you, you cook it for them.  And as long as they're not wanting to do something that can cause a foodborne illness, you do it the way they want it, the way it tastes best to them.\n\nAnd while I would happily go hungry before eating anything above a medium rare steak, and I won't even mention steak sauce, that is based on my taste buds.  Mine.\n\nThe OP didn't ask what was the best way to eat their steak, or how everybody likes their steak.   \nInstead they asked how to achieve their cooking goal.  \n\nThe amount of people telling the OP (and anyone else who seems to like their steak cooked the same way) how wrong they are for choosing to cook their steak to the level of doneness that they prefer, is wrong IMO.  Worse yet, some people have gotten pretty rude and condescending because their tastes aren't aligned.   \n\nIt's not politics, it's not religion, it's beef for God's sake.\n\nIf you don't like your steak the same way, who cares?  If somebody asked me how to drive a Chevy, I'm not going to tell them that they can only drive a Buick.  And I'm sure as heck not going to get rude about it with them.\n\nThis group is for beginners to be able to ask questions of people who know how to cook and have been cooking longer.  If someone asks a question and is treated badly for it, then what's the point of this group?\n\nManners are free, let's use them, please and thank you.",

        "selftext": "As the title says, it seems like I NEVER taste my spices outside salt and coarse black pepper. Onion/garlic powder are strong enough that I taste them. But paprika? Nothing. I added SO MUCH paprika to my eggs. Everyone says it\u2019s amazing. Nothing, except they got a bit crunchier. Basil or oregano? Nope. Thyme? It\u2019s visually pleasing, I guess. Cilantro makes my mouth itchy and smells awful, but I can actually taste that one (it\u2019s bad to me). \n\nThings like butter, citrus, vinegar, that\u2019s all fine. Red pepper flakes or cayenne have the same taste of \u201cburn\u201d (which I like, but apparently spicy things have a \u201cflavor\u201d? Spicy things have always just been Hot Flavor to me). Soy sauce has a taste but I think it\u2019s just vinegar to be honest. \n\nAt first I thought I just wasn\u2019t adding *enough*, but when I tell you I\u2019ve been drowning things in spices\u2026. And it\u2019s not even just sprinkling it on at the end\u2014 I pan fry things in spices, I follow recipes and put them on meat before cooking, mix them with my bread crumbs, add them to sauces, all sorts of things. But all I get is the salt, pepper, and general Acidy or Spicy. \n\nAnd I CAN taste things. I can taste fish and love seafood, I can enjoy different fruits and vegetables (love brussel sprouts), it\u2019s not like I am completely unable to taste things. And I can SMELL the spices and tell the difference with my nose, just not my tongue usually. I don\u2019t drink soda or anything with my meals so that isn\u2019t overpowering my mouth either. \n\nKind of wanting to go back to butter noodles with salt and vinegar. It feels the same. \n\nAm I supposed to, like, bake these spices before using them? They come in the little bottles already so I\u2019ve assumed it is fine to use them straight from there. \n\nSorry if this is a ridiculous question but I always hear \u201cjust add more than you think you need!\u201d and I am really questioning how much that is now. My egg salad is paprika red. It does not taste red. It tastes like egg.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the wonderful replies! To answer questions\n\n1. No, it was not COVID (thankfully)\n\n2. I do not smoke\n\n3. I PROMISE I am not skimping on the salt\n\n4. **Today I learned that spices expire, and oh BOY are these bad boys expired**. Oof. \n\n5. I showed my friend (the paprika fanatic) about this post and she laughed her ass off! She said she was talking about some other fancy paprika and not the regular kind in stores!!! Girl how was I supposed to know that!! But she promised to make me something with it so I can \u201cget what the fuss is about\u201d. Based on the replies, I expect to be underwhelmed. Or perhaps ascend to the Hungarian heavens. We\u2019ll see ",

        "selftext": "Seriously. It's basically just make liquid hot, add egg, stir. The way you doctor it up is completely up to you, but here's a very foundational recipe. This makes a single serving but can be scaled 1:1.\n\n*Egg Drop Soup*\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n1 cup chicken broth (or broth of your choice)\n\n1/4 to 1/3 teaspoon soy sauce, or to taste\n\nA few drops of sesame oil\n\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n\n2 teaspoons cold water\n\nPinch of salt if desired\n\nWhite pepper to taste (I don't always have this on hand and black pepper also works fine)\n\n**Method**\n\nMix together liquid ingredients in a small pot\n\nMake a slurry using the cornstarch and just a bit of cold water. To do this, whisk the cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl briskly until it combines into a thick, almost batter-like, liquid. Doing this will prevent the cornstarch from clumping up in the soup.\n\nAdd slurry to the hot broth while stirring to thicken. Now is a good time to carefully take a taste and see how much salt and pepper it needs. I like my soups salty, but having already added broth and soy sauce, this one is often salty enough already.\n\nTHE FUN PART! Beat an egg and drop that bad boy in the pot once the water comes to a low boil. Immediately turn off the heat while stirring (in one direction) as the egg will continue to cook in the residual heat. You can let it boil while stirring for a moment if you like a firmer egg, but I enjoy them whispy.\n\nEnjoy while hot! \n\n**Notes**\n\nStir either clockwise or counterclockwise, but not both. Stirring in one direction gives the eggs that whispy but fluffy texture.\n\nThe color will probably look a bit bland compared to what you are used to from takeout places. I assume they either add some coloring or maybe use a white soy sauce? I dunno, but this one is just as good.\n\nI go easy on sesame oil because I find it can easily get overpowering, but feel free to add more if you love the stuff.\n\nKeep it casual when making this. The base of it is broth, soy sauce, and egg, beyond that is your playground. This recipe is meant to be a jumping off point. I'll include some variations in the comments.",

If you're like me, you'll look at it like a canvas to use whatever I have in the fridge.\n\nChange up the flavor profile. Add a bit of rice vinegar and some sriracha for a hot and sour soup. Sub out the soy sauce for miso paste (just don't bring it to a hard boil) to make it extra comforting. Use a dashi stock instead of chicken stock if you like an oceanic flavor.\n\nJust make sure you internalize the beauty of egg drop soup. At the end of the day it's an egg stirred into hot salty water. It can be much more than that, but it's still delicious at it's most basic level. I'll admit that in a fit of laziness, I've microwaved water in a mug til very hot, added bullion and soy sauce, and cracked an egg right into it. It was still tasty and comforting. So however you choose to do it, crack that egg into some hot salty water."

I like slices that are about 1/4\" thick for this\n\nUsing a very small pinch of salt, lightly sprinkle each slice of apple with the same amount of salt. But do it at different time intervals.\n\nSalt slice one and let it sit 5 minutes. \n\nSalt slice two and let it sit 4 minutes.\n\nSalt slice three and let it sit 3 minutes.\n\nSalt slice four and let it sit 1 minute.\n\nSalt slice 5 immediately before eating it.\n\nYou should notice that the longer the salt has been on the apple, the more \"appley\" the apple will taste. The 5 minute slice likely won't be \"salty\", but will taste intensely of apple. With each slice you will notice the apple tasting less \"appley\" and slightly more like an apple with salt on it. The slice you salt immediately before eating will taste a bit bland and salty.\n\nSalt helps draw flavor out of the food, and the more time you give it penetrate and work it's magic, the deeper into the food it can get. This is one of the reasons why things like brining, marinating and dry brining are done. If you combine this method with other flavorings (herbs, spices, citrus zest, vinegar, etc) the salt helps those flavors penetrate and become part of the food too.\n\nWhen you are seasoning you food keep this in mind. Adding salt to something, especially something \"wet\", like meat, potatoes, tomatoes and allowing that salt to sit on there until absorbed, will allow the salt to penetrate into that food and make the food more flavorful. For drier raw food, like green beans, broccoli, even carrots, you can achieve the same effect by blanching in salted water.\n\nIf you are only adding seasonings (salt) at the end of your cooking process, or not letting the salt absorb, your food may taste a bit bland and salty at the same time. Giving salt the time it needs to work on your food is key to getting the most flavor out of your food.\n\nWith this method you may find that even though you are salting each individual ingredient, you may end up using less salt overall, and may not need to add salt once the food is on the plate.\n\nIt's worth experimenting around with to find how much salt, and how long that salt sits on your food before cooking it, works for your taste buds",

        "selftext": "Let's start with a story.  About a decade ago, a friend invited me over for fajita night.  He had the skirt steak marinating for 12 hours and was in the process of firing up the charcoal grill.  \"Awesome, I'll make the pico de gallo and guacamole and be right over,\" which got him excited because he had had my guacamole before.  I got there just as he was pulling the meat and it smelled wonderful.  And then, he pulled the flour tortillas out of the fridge and started assembling the tacos.  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Aren't you going to warm those tortillas up?\" I asked, and he said I could throw mine in the microwave if I wanted.  I grabbed the tortillas and tossed a few on the grill, flipping a couple of times until toasted, and told him to try one.   I swear I changed his culinary world.\n\nMy dad always said that the tortillas that we buy were only mostly cooked.  I am not sure I totally agree with that, but I do firmly believe that both corn and flour tortillas are vastly improved with a little heat treatment.  \n\nPart of that improvement comes from the fact that traditional flour tortillas are made with lard which is solid at room temperature.  Warming them up, \"melts\" the fat which makes them more pliable with a softer, moister mouth-feel.  Warming them in the microwave can accomplish this, but we can do even better.  Just as toasting can add depth to the flavor and texture of a slice of bread, so can it do the same for a tortilla.  In Mexican households, we have what is called a comal which is basically a heavy cast iron flat plate, and personally, mine never comes off the stove.  But you don't need one to do the job.  Any heavy pan big enough to hold the tortilla laying flat will do.  Pre-heat it over medium heat, toss a tortilla on it, and flip every 20-30 seconds.  As the tortilla heats, air pockets inside will expand and the parts that stay in contact with the pan will brown and get crispy.  If you have never had a flour tortilla done this way, please try it.  A good tortilla can outshine the filling when done right.  \n\nAs for corn tortillas, they are not made with any fat at all.  That is why I will always fry them in a bit of lard before eating.  If you don't keep lard in your kitchen, vegetable oil will do,  It doesn't take much fat, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, also at medium heat.  You can lightly fry them until the edges start to brown a little for a flexible tortilla or until they blister for a shell that will be crunchy once it cools.  This is a must for tostada shells.  You can even take some aluminum foil and fold it into a taco shape that will stand up on its own upside down.  When you pull the tortilla, drape it over your taco form and it will harden into that shape as it cools.  No more buying Old El Paso pre-formed taco shells.  This method also works on an upside-down bowl for mini taco salad bowls.  You could also take a few and cut into quarters, lightly fry, and then scramble with eggs for a dish my family calls Migas.  But the best thing I do with a corn tortilla is fry one side and flip, put a heaping handful of shredded Monterey Jack chees on it, and fold in half.  Fry both sides until crunchy, salt, and enjoy a quesadilla that blows the ones at your local TexMex joint out of the water.  \n\nTortillas, both flour and corn, are absolutely essential to Mexican and TexMex cuisine.  They really deserve to be treated as more than a wrapper for something delicious.  When done right, they are the something delicious.",

Full of umami. And oh so delicious. It will give you the ability to add big flavor to a dish with little effort.\u2800\n\nBut that\u2019s not a guarantee. If you\u2019re adding tomato paste straight to the liquid, you're missing out on flavor! \n\nSo here\u2019s the trick. Always brown your tomato paste. Whether you cook it on its own or add it to a pan full of onions, celery, and carrots, give the paste and the fat-filled pan plenty of 1-on-1 time. You want to caramelize the tomato paste until it turns a deep red color. \u2800\n\nIf you\u2019re cooking aromatic vegetables for the base of a sauce or soup, wait until they are almost done. And then add your tomato paste. Crank the heat up slightly and stir frequently so it doesn\u2019t burn. You want to suck all the brightness out of it!\u2800\n\nOnce it\u2019s turned maroon, make sure to deglaze the pan with wine, stock, or even water. You\u2019ll pick up all the flavor stuck on the bottom of the pan from the browned paste. #SaveTheFond\n\nDon\u2019t use tomato paste?

But I've had to check my own mentality at times in my cooking journey, so I thought a reminder may be encouraging to those just getting into cooking.\n\nFood can be ugly and still be incredible. You can deviate from tradition when making something and still have a fantastic end result. You can go off the rails on recipes or make your own mad scientist type creations. Who gives a shit if it's not \"authentic\" or \"proper\" if it's good. And even if it's not good, you can learn from it and try again very soon because we have to eat or ya know, we'll die.\n\nFinally, don't do it for the 'gram unless you just enjoy food photography like me, and even if you do don't prioritize looks over taste. Yes we \"taste with our eyes\", that's a real thing, so make it pretty if you can/want. But I can assure you that some of the best dishes I've ever had look absolutely terrible when photographed. My family forcibly demands my chicken and drop-dumplings once a week and it looks like prison food.\n\nSo enjoy the nice pictures and fun videos of people cooking difficult, pretty, complex dishes. I do. But don't let the arms race of cooking media ever discourage you from getting into the kitchen, having fun, and sustaining yourself. I'm about to take another shot at recreating an exact replica of Taco Bell's chicken flatbread because damn it I miss that menu item and I don't care who judges me.\n\nAnd since I need a flair, here's a recipe for Raising Cane's sauce in hopes that I can cut down on the ridiculous traffic from people lining up into the street to get mediocre fried chicken on my town's main thoroughfare. Yeah I know I'm being a hypocrite, but come on, Zaxby's is right down the street and it's way better.\n\nCombine 2 parts mayo to 1 part Ketchup and add a bit of mustard. I prefer horseradish or dijon mustard but yellow works fine and gets a better color. I don't know if they actually use mustard, but I find that adding a small squeeze of it adds a lot to the sauce. Mix in a splash of worchestershire sauce along with pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Taste it and adjust to your taste. Adding a bit of salt is probably going to be necessary, but I like to do that last since the worchestershire sauce can bring a lot of sodium to the party. Personally, I like mine quite peppery.  Dip some buttered garlic toast in it and you have the best part of Cane's without having to go sit in the middle of the road holding everyone up to pay too much money for it.",

I would consider myself an intermediate cook but my nerves can really get the better of me in the kitchen.\n\nSo I was super nervous all day but I managed to pull it off!! Here was my menu:\n\nStarter: Salmon tartare with ciabatta bread\nLink:https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/fish-and-seafood/smoky-salmon-tartare-with-lemon-and-capers/\n\nMains: Herb-crusted, pan-fried lamb chops with roast carrots and parnsips, butterbean puree and a red wine sauce\nLink:https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/8292-herb-crusted-lamb-chops\n\n\nDessert: Vanilla panna cotta with strawberry compote\nLink:https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vanilla-panna-cotta\n\nI made every thing from scratch (P.S I had never made any of these dishes before) and I got a bit flustered getting the timings right for the mains hut the food was delicious. My boyfriend was really pleased and I've come away with renewed confidence in my cooking abilities.\n\nSo here's a post to say - set yourself that cooking challenge! Only good can come out of it, either you make a mistake and learn or you do really well and get a huge confidence boost :)\n\nTip: If you feel nervous at the time or in anticipation of cooking (I did) instead of giving in to those thoughts, tell yourself you're just excited!!! It can really change the way you feel and you can trick yourself into changing anxiety into a good feeling.",

        "title": "Flatbread doesn't have to be complicated, and you probably have what you need to make it.",
        "selftext": "In fact, all you really need to make a basic flatbread is flour, water, and salt. Even the salt isn't necessary really. Hell, you don't even need a bowl or a spoon. You can make a pile of flour on your counter (cleaned counter I hope), make a little well in the center, and slowly mix in water with your hands until it forms a dough. Then squish it and toss it on a hot surface and you've got a basic flatbread that could be made on a rock in the woods with no tools other than the means to make fire.\n\nNow that we've gone to the extreme end of simplification and removed the mystery of making probably the world's oldest bread product, I'll go into a leavened version that is only a tiny bit more complex, but will yield fluffy, chewy flatbreads with those characteristic air pockets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: These amounts are mostly a guideline, not a hard and fast rule. Think of it as a starting point, in no time you won't even need to get near a measuring cup to make it.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n\n1 1/2-2 teaspoons baking powder\n\nA pinch of salt\n\n3/4 cup of water\n\n1 tablespoon of oil\n\n**Instructions**\n\nIf you want to get fancy, use a bowl. For the record though, you can absolutely make this using the pile of flour method if you want. That counter's gonna get flour on it anyway so why not.\n\nMix together flour, baking powder, and salt. If you'd like to flavor it up with other seasonings (garlic powder for example) add it now.\n\nAdd the water a small amount at a time and begin mixing together by hand, or with a spoon, or a stick or something.\n\nOnce a rough dough begins to form, add the olive oil and mix by hand until a cohesive ball has formed. Add flour/liquid if needed during this process. We want dough that is pliable, but not too sticky.\n\nDust the counter (for the love of god make sure it's clean first) with flour and plop that dough boy on there. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it slowly springs back when you poke it.\n\nNow we will portion it into balls somewhere between golf ball and baseball sized. A bench scraper is ideal for this, but I use an old, dull knife to separate into chunks.\n\nMake the dough flat. My favorite way to do this is by gently pressing it out with my fingertips until it is about 1/4 inch thick, occasionally picking it up by the edges to stretch it out. I find that by hand-working the dough, we preserve more of the gluten structure formed from the kneading process. You can also roll it out with a rolling pin, can of beans, beer bottle, whatever. It'll still be very good, just make sure it's flat.\n\nHeat a skillet to medium-high, using a bit of cooking spray if you feel it may get sticky (totally optional). Slap a flat-dough on there and watch it bubble up for a minute or two. Once the underside has gotten nice and browned and it's puffed up a bit, gently flip and cook for another minute or two, until the bubbles on the bottom have browned up. After flipping I like to mush it down very gently with the spatula to slightly even out the browning, but honestly I mostly do that cause it's fun.\n\nAs flatbreads finish cooking, place them in a stack on a plate and cover them with a towel. The residual heat will slightly steam them, making them soft and pliable.\n\nEnjoy with wraps, curry, or topped with softened butter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add the cost breakdown (sorry for the crappy formatting, I couldn't sleep so I just threw this together to illustrate how cheap it is:\n\n \n\nFlour: 10lb for 2.24   -   $0.45\n\nOlive Oil: 93 tbsp for 15.88   -   $0.17 for recipe\n\nWater: 24 pack for 9.94   -  $0.45  for recipe (with some left over to drink) \n\nKosher salt: 3 pounds for 16.99 (Diamond Crystal)   -  $0.02 for recipe\n\nBaking powder: 22 oz for 5.28   -   $0.02 for recipe\n\nTotal cost for 4 flatbreads: $1.11\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuys and gals, that's a buck for a pile of flatbread and a lot of experience working with dough. Plus, as you can see, I was even being extravagant on the price by using bottled water and a mid-priced bottle of olive oil. I don't actually even cook with bottled water and you can use oil that is cheaper to still get great results. Realistically if you're using tap water, I see the cost of this being more like 75 cents.\n\nSo there it is if you needed more incentive. About a dollar (probably less) and you can get more familiar with making bread, plus the end result is fresh flatbread for 2-3 people.",

        "title": "How to Make Chicken Breasts Not Suck: A Complete Guide for Beginners",
        "selftext": "Dry. Chalky. Rubbery. Spongey. Crunchy. Bland. Tasteless. These are all common adjectives used to describe chicken breasts. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Chicken breasts can be juicy, delicate, and full of flavor, and I\u2019m going to help you achieve that. \n\nThere are just four things you need to know, so this serves as the **TL;DR** for this very long post:\n\n1. Buy air-chilled\n\n2. Make cutlets\n\n3. Salt properly\n\n  a. Light flour coating\n\n4. Cook to the correct temperature\n\nAnd if you are so inclined, I will cover each of these in great detail below. \n\n## 1. Air-chilled\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d, right? Keep that in mind as I explain this. \n\nIn the US, more than 95% of chickens are processed using a liquid-cooled solution^[1](https://www.bellandevans.com/healthy-living/chlorinated-chicken-concerns-europe-overreacting/). This means they are submerged in ice-cold chlorinated water, and after this, some are then injected with a salt water brine solution, sometimes referred to as broth. As a result of this process, the chicken retains some of that water. It is easy to identify this if you read the fine print on the packaging. See examples below:\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 1%](https://i.imgur.com/gBSVam6.jpg)\n\n[Tyson brand, up to 3%](https://i.imgur.com/Vj333Dw.jpg)\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 10%](https://i.imgur.com/eRMgQr7.jpg)\n\n[Walmart brand, up to ***15%!!***](https://i.imgur.com/IBhQILK.png)\n\n\nFrozen chicken breasts are most often the ones that are also injected (sometimes called enhanced) with a salt water brine, and usually contain up to 15% retained water^[1](https://i.imgur.com/itbyASa.png) ^[2](https://i.imgur.com/eZS9RaD.jpg)\n\nSo why does this matter? Put simply, it is diluting the chicken flavor and changing the texture. Also, the weight of the chicken you are buying is calculated after it is injected or cooled in a bath. That means you are paying chicken prices for this added salt water.\n\nAir-chilled chicken is just as it sounds. Instead of submerging the chicken in ice-cold chlorinated water, these chickens are essentially chilled in a massive refrigerator. This is actually more expensive for the manufacturers, so that translates to higher prices for consumers. At my local grocery store, air chilled chicken breasts are over 3x the cost of standard chicken breasts ($1.99/lb vs $6.69/lb). Whether or not that is worth it is up to you, but I can tell you that I will never go back to the cheap breasts again. Again, just check the labels. Anything that is air-chilled will be labeled as such. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/AgzIUgl.jpg), [here](https://i.imgur.com/0OT2Z5Z.png), and [here](https://i.imgur.com/p4PoL8u.jpg). \n\nWhat about organic chicken? Well, not all organic chicken is air-chilled, and not all air-chilled chicken is organic. I personally do not think *organic* air-chilled chicken is worth the extra cost (around $10/lb near me), it does not taste any better than non-organic *air-chilled* chicken, in my experience. Keep in mind that any company that is producing air-chilled chicken is likely more concerned about producing a quality product than a company that is using liquid cooling. \n\n## 2. Cutlets \nPart of the challenge when cooking chicken breast is having a tapered piece of meat that will always cook unevenly. This will result in the thin side being completely overdone when the thickest side is perfect. Or if the thin side is perfect, the thickest side is still raw. So the only way to combat this is to make the entire piece the same thickness. [Enter the cutlet](https://i.imgur.com/egyDjGE.jpg). \n\nYou will absolutely need a very sharp knife for this, but since that is arguably the #1 most important tool in the kitchen, it\u2019s safe for me to assume that you already have one of those, right? I like to use a boning knife for this, but a chef\u2019s knife will work. \n\nIf your chicken breasts have the tenderloin still attached, you will want to cut that off and cook it separately because it will create an air pocket, and sometimes things will not cook properly if it is still attached. [See here](https://youtu.be/2BeQftjYNO4?t=21). Just think of it as a bonus for the cook.\n\nNow this next step is sort of optional, but if you are working with very large breasts (around 7-9 ounces each), then I consider it mandatory. Use your very sharp knife that you most definitely already have, and slice that chicken breast in half *horizontally*. [See here](https://youtu.be/MrVIHL7JkTM?t=126). Alternatively, you can cut them in half *vertically* first, and then slice the thicker end in half horizontally. This will create smaller portions, if you would like, and it will be a bit easier to cut them horizontally. [See here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=23).\n\nNow that you have your portions ready, you need to ensure they are all an even thickness by *gently* pounding them to about \u00bc\u201d-\u00bd\u201d thickness. Emphasis on gently because it is very possible to explode your chicken breasts. Lay some plastic wrap over the chicken cutlets and use a meat pounder or mallet on the thickest parts of the cutlets. The key is to create an even thickness, it doesn\u2019t really matter how thick they actually are. You will see this process in the video I linked to above. If you do not have a meat pounder or mallet, you can use a small pot. \n\n## 3. Salt \nThis should be a very deliberate thing. Salt and savory cooking are a package deal. There should never be a time where you forget salt, because it should just be second nature to add salt to things that you want to taste good. Bland and lacking salt are synonymous. \nWhen it comes to cooking chicken (and meat in general), it should be even more deliberate. Salt not only enhances the flavor of our food, but in the case of chicken breast, it actually helps to retain much of the liquid that is lost during the cooking process, and creates more tender cooked chicken. [Here](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) is a very thorough write-up if you want to read more about it. \n\nOn top of retaining more liquid, it obviously adds flavor, but it\u2019s very easy to add too much, or too little. We\u2019ve all heard that we should \u201csalt to taste\u201d, but there are some things where this doesn\u2019t work very well, like salting your raw chicken breast before cooking it. Fortunately, the good folks at [Cook\u2019s Illustrated have this figured out for us](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5681-salting-meat) (the formatting of that page seems to be broken currently). I can personally attest that the amount of salt listed in the aforementioned article is perfect, for my and my family\u2019s tastes, you may want a bit more or a bit less. \u00be teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of boneless poultry is what they suggest. The brand of salt is also very important. If you aren\u2019t already aware, 1 teaspoon table salt = 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt^[1](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5799-salt-types-and-measurements)\n\nSo let\u2019s look at a realistic example: Say you bought a package of fresh air-chilled chicken breast and the total weight listed on the package is 1.67 pounds. How much salt do you add? ***Edit: this part is not true!*** ~~Well, for starters, that weight is for the entire package of chicken, not just the meat you are going to be eating. Surprise! That\u2019s right, grocery stores weigh the entire package when printing their labels, so you are paying for the packaging as well.~~ So if you start with a package that is 1.67 pounds, you can safely round down to 1.5 pounds, so that means 1.5 teaspoons of Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt, or \u00be teaspoon of any fine table salt. \n\n*When* you add the salt is also very important. Unlike spices and herbs, salt actually penetrates fully throughout the meat, and it does so at a rate that increases as the temperature increases. \n\nAssuming you have cutlets and pounded them thin, next you will want to sprinkle on the appropriate amount of salt, let it sit on a plate or baking sheet at room temp while you continue prepping the rest of your meal. Since this should be your first step, your chicken will only be sitting out for about 30 minutes at room temp, so it is perfectly safe. \n\nBecause salt is hygroscopic, it will begin to draw the moisture out of the chicken, which will in turn dissolve the salt, and then most of that salt water will be reabsorbed back into the chicken. You can actually watch this process happen if you take a close look at your salted chicken every 5 minutes or so. \n\nAt this point, feel free to take whatever creative measures you wish with any other spices or herbs. But the point should remain that salt is the #1 concern at this stage. In fact, a properly salted chicken breast will taste good without the addition of any other spices or herbs. I would even suggest that you try this first so that you can establish a baseline for what good chicken should taste like.\n\nNext, before cooking, there is one final semi-optional step. I say semi-optional because I think the only exception for skipping this is if you have Celiac disease or are counting calories. \n\n### 3a. Flour\n\nCoating your cutlets in a very light layer of flour will protect the outer surface of the chicken from the high heat and it prevents the edges of the chicken from becoming too dry. It really does wonders for the final product. You can see this process in one of the previous videos I linked to, [here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=111). You only need a couple tablespoons of flour per breast, this is not fried chicken. Even if you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, I\u2019m sure you could simply use alternative flours for this. \n\n## 4. Cook\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we talk about temperature first. I think the #1 concern for most people about cooking chicken is that you ensure it is cooked thoroughly, as to kill off any salmonella that may be present. The FDA/USDA tells us that we should cook our chicken to 165F because that is the temperature that salmonella (and most other bad bacteria) are killed instantly at, and this just simplifies everything so that there is only one standard to remember, and it is safe for all types of immune systems. What they are not telling you is that bacteria (including salmonella) can be killed off by both temperature *and* time. This is how we pasteurize dairy products without cooking them. You hold them at very specific temperatures for very specific amounts of time. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about temperatures. Remember, 165F is the temp at which bacteria are killed *instantly*. Unfortunately, your chicken is damn near overcooked at this point. You can safely cook your chicken to 150F as long as it maintains a minimum of 150F for just 3 minutes. [This source](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-chicken-breast.html) has a very clear time and temperature chart for a reference, and all data comes from the same people that told you to cook to 165F. So once your chicken reaches a minimum of 150F in the thickest part (since you\u2019ve presumably made evenly sized cutlets, there should be no drastically different \u201cthickest part\u201d), you want to pull it from the hot pan and let it sit on a plate (ideally a warmed plate) for at least 5 minutes. Remember to check the temperature in several different spots of the chicken so you can be sure. During the resting time, the temperature will actually rise a bit, thanks to carry over cooking, by about 2-5 degrees or so. Thicker cuts rise more, thinner cuts rise less. If it actually reaches 155F, then everything bad will have been killed off in less than 48 seconds. \n\nI will add a disclaimer here to say that if you are cooking for any children, elderly, pregnant women, or otherwise immunocompromised, cooking to 165F is always the safest option. \n\nSo if you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, you will absolutely need a digital instant read thermometer. This isn\u2019t something you can or should guess at. The thermometer is mandatory, it\u2019s as simple as that. I can provide some good recommendations for different budgets if you would like.  \n\nI will always opt for pan frying in this case. I do not think baking thinly sliced chicken breasts with a light coating of flour will work well. In fact, this entire post is basically to discourage people from trying to bake their oversized chicken breasts in the oven. It\u2019s just not a good method, for many reasons. We really need the high heat and direct contact of a skillet to achieve some browning. Browning things creates new flavors, it is important, and it should be something you are deliberately trying to achieve. \n\nI prefer a stainless steel pan for this, but cast iron will work as well. You want to pre-heat your pan over med-high heat with at least 2 tablespoons of oil in it. You will need slightly more oil than you would normally use, as the light coating of flour will soak up a good amount of the oil. Once that oil begins to shimmer and then you see the first wisps of smoke, it is time to add the chicken. \n\nWe are using a hard and fast cooking style. Since these cutlets are so thin, they will cook very quickly, so we want to achieve a deeply browned exterior before overcooking the middle, which is only possible over fairly high heat. \n\nSlowly lay down each cutlet into the hot oil so that you are moving your hand away from you, as to avoid any hot oil splashes. You should hear a hard sizzle almost immediately, this is a good sign. Most 12\u201d skillets should be able to easily fit 3 cutlets at one time, maybe 4 depending on the size of chicken. This is also a good time to use a splatter screen, if you have one. \n\nAfter adding the chicken, you may want to turn the heat up to high, but be ready to turn it back down again if things get too dark, too quickly. Let the chicken cook undisturbed until the edges of the chicken begin to turn white. Then it\u2019s time to start peaking at the bottom. It\u2019s probably a good idea to rotate each cutlet 180 degrees so that they brown more evenly. You probably have some hotspots in your pan. Once each cutlet achieves a deeply browned surface on the one side, then flip it. If you notice the pan is rather dry when you flip it, add more oil to the spot that is dry. Now keep cooking the second side until you reach a minimum 150F internal temp. You should be more concerned about this temperature than you are about browning on the second side. Now pull each cutlet and transfer them to a warmed plate to rest for 5 minutes. \n\n## Bonus - Pan Sauces\nSo now that you have your pan-fried chicken cutlets resting, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to make a pan sauce. In fact, this cooking method is worth doing just for this opportunity alone. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t use a nonstick skillet, you should now see a lot of [built up brown bits](https://i.imgur.com/M45PnAv.jpg), called fond, on the bottom of your pan. If you did use a nonstick skillet, well, then no fond for you! If the fond looks black and burnt, your heat was too high for too long, and you should skip this step. \nPut your pan back on the heat, medium heat is fine. Get your fond hot, and before it starts to darken, you need to add liquid. You can simply add water, but chicken stock is a better option. If you have it, some white wine along with the water or stock is also a great idea. How much? It doesn\u2019t really matter. Maybe enough so that it\u2019s at least \u215b\u201d deep. Now, bring it to a simmer, and use a flat wooden spoon and start scraping all of that fond up until the bottom of the pan is completely clean. Once you\u2019ve achieved that, let it simmer until it\u2019s reduced slightly. The residual flour in the pan should help thicken the sauce ever so slightly. It\u2019s easy to over reduce at this point, since you are using a wide and shallow pan, so take it off the heat as soon as it\u2019s where you want it. \n\nAt this point, you just need to stir in 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then give it a taste. Add salt until it tastes good. That\u2019s about as simple as you can go, or you can do any of the following to make it even better\n\n* Before adding the liquid, add 1 tablespoon of flour to the fond and cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until the flour begins to toast. This will add more flavor and more body to the pan sauce.\n\n* Along with the flour, add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, and cook until the tomato paste turns rust colored. This adds even more flavor. \n\n* To your cold water or boxed stock, sprinkle on a packet of unflavored gelatin and allow it to bloom for a couple minutes before adding to the hot pan. This adds more body to your pan sauce. You don\u2019t need to do this if you are using homemade stock. \n\n* Before adding the liquid, add some minced shallots and a bit of oil to the hot pan and cook for a couple minutes.\n\n* After adding the butter, whisk in some fresh lemon juice and capers or dijon mustard. The addition of acid is almost always a good idea. \n\n---\n\nLastly, a message to all of the chicken thigh cult members out there, because I know that you are a passionate bunch. I, too, love chicken thighs. This post is not meant to spark a debate between white meat and dark meat, this is simply meant to help those that have not had any success making delicious chicken breasts.",

This is a topic I'm weirdly passionate about. \n\nHonestly the single best tip I ever got for making juicy chicken (especially breasts) is to always brine it myself before use. Every time. Even one hour of brining makes a difference. I'm a lazy cook most of the time and even for me it's become an unskippable step.\n\nYou can honestly just soak it in salty water. \n\nWanna get fancy? Add some soy sauce to the brine. Even for non-Asian applications. You can even add brown sugar if you really want to go crazy. I've got a super easy exact recipe for chicken brine if anyone is interested."

You've got a few options.\n\n Option one is if it's edible but just bland and the crust is chalky. \n\nAll she needs to do is whip up a very thinned out very flavorful sauce, plop the chicken in the biggest roasting tray you have, pour the sauce allllll over the chicken, cover it up nice and tight with foil or a lid, and then stick in the oven at 275 for an hour or so. If it starts to get thick, add more water. \n\nTo get a thin sauce, just take a regular bottled sauce you already have (or pick it up at the store) and thin it out with warm water, diluted apple juice, or beer. Then add as much hot sauce and salt as it needs to taste just a little too hot and too salty. Remember you've got some bland chicken, so you'll need to balance it out.\n\nThe other option is just literally wash the coating off the cooked chicken under running water. Then pull the meat off the bone. You can then use that for whatever you'd use shredded chicken for. Chicken n' dumplings, enchiladas, pulled chicken bbq sliders, King Ranch casserole. Lots of options!\n\nAnd as a note of encouragement, it's almost impossible to count how many great, classic meals were developed in restaurants to salvage something a cook originally messed up."

Almost like I remember meat tasting like (but take that with a grain of salt, I barely have eaten meat in over 3 years). I remember them being wet, almost like covered in an oil? As this was maybe the second time tasting mushrooms in my life, I thought that maybe they just tasted that way. So I made a pizza and put canned sliced mushrooms from Walmart on it. It was not good. It didn't taste anything like I remember meat tasting. I also tried Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup and it didn't taste right either.\n\nSo any clue what they did to the mushrooms?

I'm talking about your actual value as a human being for another human being.\n\nSomewhere between money, lifestyle and status people forget that relationships are built in the trenches.  You often fall in love with someone because they make you chicken soup when you're sick or prepare a decent rigatoni the first time they meet your parents or your friends can't believe they woke up early to make everyone crepes on a hungover Sunday.\n\nThe ability to cook is a serious attribute. Much like the ability to make someone laugh is a serious attribute. Much like showing up on time and being reliable when sh\\*t hits the fan is a serious attribute.\n\nSo why learn to cook? I mean, really put time and effort into learning how to cook?\n\nBecause then you can host and hosting will open more social doors for you than you'll ever imagine.  You can be mediocre by all accounts and you obliterate loneliness by simply saying \"Hey I'm making a big dinner tonight come by and bring your friends\" (people rarely turn down a free meal especially in their 20's).\n\nAll I'm trying to say is learning to cook for yourself is motivation but you'll be surprised how much more motivating it is to learn to cook so you can make other people happy.\n\nIn 2023, between between Door Dash and and the Chipotle-fication of restaurants you don't NEED to know how to cook like you did out of necessity in 1965.

With each dish of theirs that I cook, I can easily figure out how to adapt it for my own means.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!  About 6 years ago I was a hopeless cook. I'd eat pasta or noodles every meal and it would always be bland and boring. Since then I've worked hard to try and become a better chef and I wanted to share some general tips that have helped me cook better. \n\nPrep: \nAlways prep before you start. There's no better way to guarantee your meal will be burnt than trying to chop the potatoes while your onion fries. Have everything chopped/grated/out of the pantry before you switch the heat on. Also clear your work space, it helps you track what's going into the pan and when. Switch on the oven and let it preheat if you need it. \n\n\nHerbs: \nFresh is best. If you use dried it usually for baking and even then don't over use as they can be bitter. \n\nRosemary, oregano and thyme are good baking herbs. Use them when you intend to bake something in the oven and they'll add great flavour and aromatics. They tend to pair well with meat or starchy veg.\n\nParsley and Coriander are softer herbs and won't stand up to baking. Instead add them towards the end of cooking to get their full flavour. \n\nBasil is definitely an aromatic. That means it tastes bad on its own but the smell is what adds to your cooking. It should be added right at the end of cooking when the heat is off!\n\n\nSpices:\nFirstly make sure you have all the staples. I'd include cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric, paprika, nutmeg, ginger, sumac and chili flakes as my go to spices. Buy the big bags from Asian groceries to keep the price down and refill glass jars. \n\nMake sure you add spices early either as a marinade with oil on your meat/veg or at the very least before you add any liquid to your dish. \n\nUse recipes as inspiration for what combos of spices and herbs go well together. \n\nCumin is my favourite spice. This is because I find it so versatile and can be found in many of the cuisines I cook. For example you can pair it with paprika if your making fajitas, or with turmeric in a curry. Add it to some mince alone and make a kebab. \n\nChilli flakes are the one spice worth spending a little more on. Cheap flakes or chili powder add a hot but nasty shallow taste to your food. Instead go for aleppo or Urfa chili flakes if you can find them, your food will instantly be richer. \n\nSumac is good with red meat, add it after cooking and it will add a nice lemony taste that'll make your dish more interesting. \n\nOther ingredients:\nSalt - Add early especially to meat. I usually sprinkle before I even start cooking. If your adding liquid make sure you taste and sprinkle again if needed. \n\nGarlic - Garlic is getting is the king of aromatics and flavour. I use it in most meals. Frequently I add it early to the pan and fry on a low heat to keep it from burning (depending on the meal I can do this for up to 5 mins!) . Then whack up the heat just before you cook whatever else you have. \n\nFlour - Defintely can be your friend when cooking meat. A sprinkling (maybe half a handful) of flour added before cooking will help your meat pick up flavour from galric/spices and make it richer. It can also be used when thickening a sauce, but it can't work miracles, just carefully pour away excess liquid. \n\nButter/salt/sugar - If you're not worried about your health just put a lot of these ingredients in. Tbh you can't go wrong on quantities (within reason!) and they will improve just about any dish. I add salt and sugar early and then butter towards the end as it can make a dish richer. \n\nEquipment:\nKnives- Tip I learnt from Anthony Bourdain. A few quality pieces of cookware are much better than cupboards of tat.  Just have one good chopping knife. It should be large and kept very sharp. Make sure you buy a proper knife sharpener to go with it.\n\nPans- I mostly use one large frying pan which has high sides and is oven proof. Most of my dishes are made on the stove top but I've learnt that I can confidently put it in the oven too. I primarily do this when I want to fry meat to get that nice seared taste but then want to bake the dish to get a richer flavour in the liquid. \n\n\nHope these tips help, I'm sure there is more I have forgotten ill add later. \n\nI'll try to answer any follow up questions when I get the chance.",

        "title": "I'll never buy boxed macaroni and cheese again.",
        "selftext": "This works with any kind of pasta - fusilli, penne, macaroni, angel hair, spaghetti, whatever. You can buy it in bulk, store brand, for pretty good prices, especially when it's on sale. Stock up if it goes on sale.\n\nThen you want deli American cheese, not the prepackaged stuff. Yes it matters, because yes it's different. (And better!)\n\nSalt the water and boil the pasta according to directions. I like mine on the firmer side so when the box says \"cooks in 10-12 minutes\" I pull it at 9-10 minutes. If it says 5-6 minutes (like angel hair) I pull it at 4 minutes or so, if the noodles are really pliable when I stir them. (Side note, most directions vastly overstate the amount of water you need. In general you want the pasta completely covered with at least an inch of water on top of it. You don't have to wait the 20 minutes it takes to boil four quarts of water for a box of spaghetti noodles. Use a large sauce pan and break them in half and then apply gentle pressure until they soften and are submerged, for example.)\n\nDrain into a colander but don't do a good job of it - you want some of that salted water in reserve, probably 2-3 tablespoons per serving you're cooking. Alternately you can just ladel some into a cup or bowl right before you strain the noodles. \n\nPut the noodles back in the pot with the water you saved (or that you didn't pour out) and and add 2-3 slices of cheese per serving, ripped into quarters or halves, and then stir until it's all melted and you have a cheese sauce. This takes approximately a minute or so, if you do it immediately. The residual heat on the noodles and the water you saved (immediately prior to straining) is enough to get the job done. It's that fast.\n\nThis doesn't sound like it would be good but it is phenomenal. You can also add grated parmesan or some other cheese if you want to fancy it up, but be aware that many 'harder' cheeses will not melt and emulsify well. Also shaker can parmesan (and anything pre-shredded in a bag) is treated with corn starch, which isn't really a problem for me but might be for some of you. (You want an emulsifier like sodium citrate or even good old mustard powder for some cheese, experiment if you want, and if you're really going all out you want to do this separately in a little sauce pan.)\n\nIf you use less water you can add a splash of milk, but it's not required.\n\nAdd salt and pepper, garlic, oregano or basil if you want. I sometimes add in a spoonful of basil pesto for a completely different experience.\n\nYou can get American cheese from the deli for $4-$6 per pound in most markets I'd imagine, or $8-$9 per pound for Boar's Head. I've never really counted slices but this is enough cheese for a good number of batches. It's a little more expensive than the prepackaged stuff but that's because it's actual cheese and not 'cheese product'. It's worth it. You can also use it on sandwiches and melts.\n\nIf no one watches you make this, they'll have no idea what you did and will assume you are a wizard when you say you didn't make it from a box, when in fact you got the idea from the cookingforbeginners subreddit.\n\nAdd peas and tuna for homemade tuna helper. Add steamed broccoli for noodles and broccoli in cheese sauce. Add browned ground beef and chili powder and some jalapenos or diced chipotles for chili mac.",

[Twin Moons Tavern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BgAdknPFXA) is a good example of this from an audio and lighting standpoint. Compare that to [Debbie Wong's Wok and Gong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxGWa95kDvA) that has the host mic'd, great lighting, and a great job of framing the shot.

Bits of whatever. \n\nYou make soup in basically that order. You want a big pot where you're going to cook down aromatic flavors with some butter. If you're making a cream-based soup you're going to make a roux with the butter and some milk. Otherwise you're going to dump in whatever stock or soup base you want. For chili that's tomatoes, for chicken noodle that's chicken stock, for beef and whatever, that's beef stock. That becomes the base (aromatics + soup base). \n\nAfter that, you just add ingredients in order of how long they need to cook. In a chicken noodle, for example, you're going to add the seasonings + chicken and veggies and let that cook for a long while, and add noodles at the end. You add noodles at the end because the noodles only need a short amount of time, whereas carrots and chicken need a bit longer. In a potato soup, you might add sour cream or shredded cheddar in at the end because you only want that to cook for a few minutes as opposed to the 30 you'd give the potatoes. \n\nAll soups follow that basic structure. All that changes is what stock you use and what ingredients you add."

Thankfully this is the third time I've made it now but the first time I got it \"right\" lol.

        "title": "You can make Chicken and Dumplings from scratch much more easily than you think and it's very cheap!",
        "selftext": " \n\n**\"Rustic\" Chicken and Dumplings**\n\nThis comforting and hearty recipe may be the epitome of cooking with what you've got. I've always gone with my eyes and by feel/taste, so take my measurements with a very hefty grain of salt. At the end of the day we are making thick chicken soup and dropping biscuit dough in. Feel free to mix it up however you want using this foundation\n\n**Ingredients for the chicken part**\n\n4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (just trust me, okay)\n\n1 medium onion, yellow or white\n\n3 or 4 cloves of garlic, minced\n\nA few tablespoons of oil or butter\n\n4 cups of chicken stock, or enough to cover at least half of the chicken thighs (I use bullion and water)\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nAromatics of choice if desired/available\n\n**Ingredients for the dumplings**\n\n2 cups AP flour\n\n2 to 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in general you want about 1 teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour)\n\n1 teaspoon white sugar\n\nPinch of salt to taste\n\n1/2 cup chilled butter (make sure it's cold)\n\n1 1/4 cups whole milk (also make sure it's cold)\n\n**Method**\n\nHeat a large pot over medium heat and add oil/butter to coat the bottom. Rub chicken thighs with a pinch of salt and place skin side down into the pot.\n\nWhile the chicken is browning, dice the onion roughly and mince the garlic.\n\nOnce the chicken thighs have gotten some color on the skin, flip them and add the onions. Let cook until the onions begin to soften.\n\nAfter onions have softened, add minced garlic. Be sure to keep the garlic moving and be ready to take off the heat if it begins to burn at all.\n\nAfter a few minutes the garlic should be a golden brown and the onion should be lightly caramelized. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the chicken stock (aim for the chicken to be at least halfway covered and seasonings of choice. Salt and pepper will be just fine, but if you want to add aromatics or other seasonings go for it. I basically never make it the same way twice. I suggest going a bit easy for now since ideally we want that chicken fully cooked before taste testing. We can always add more later.\n\nCover the pot and let simmer until the chicken begins to fall apart, at least 30 minutes.\n\nTo make the dumplings\n\nBegin this process once the chicken is starting to get fully cooked and tender.\n\nMix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt thoroughly in a medium bowl. I like to add a bit of garlic powder as well but that's optional. Cut cold butter into small chunks and incorporate into the dry mixture. Use a fork, your hands, a stick, whatever. We just want small solid pieces of butter, roughly pea-sized.\n\nMix with utensil of choice until it forms into a very wet, shaggy dough. It will be sticky and almost more of a very thick batter when ready.\n\n**To finish it up**\n\nBy this point, the chicken should be falling off the bone and shredding easily in the pot. Pull those bones out with tongs or really anything that's not your hand. Give the chicken a rustling to get it nice and broken up, and it's time to drop those dumplings!\n\nUsing a spoon or your hands, pull out small chunks of the dough/batter and drop them into the soup. It will be a bit sticky and messy, and it won't be a pageant winner visually. Once again I am asking you to trust me. Stay conservative on scooping the dumplings as they will at least double in size, typically more. A tablespoon or so per dumpling serves me well.\n\nCook uncovered for about 10 minutes, then cover and cook for about another 10 minutes, or until the dumplings have firmed up and doubled.\n\n**EAT IT**\n\nWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! No need to let this rest. Go ahead and serve it up and eat it hot. If you are unsure of the doneness of the dumplings, pull one out and have a chef snack. It should be pillowy soft with just a bit of chew. Cooking for longer produces a chewier dumpling if that's what you prefer.\n\n**Notes**\n\nI know bone-in, skin-on thighs may raise some eyebrows. In my experience, it adds a ton of flavor and texture to the dish overall. Plus they are super cheap compared to other cuts. The skin is easy to take out after it's imparted it's delicious fatty flavor, if you prefer. Other cuts of chicken would also be fine if you'd like to go leaner, or if you only have a different cut on hand. If using white meat, be gentler on the heat and time.\n\nThe dumplings almost always end up being the star of the show, which is why I use drop dumplings instead of a more doughy dumpling. They are like pillowy flavor sponges and they thicken the broth on their own. If you prefer a thicker/chewier dumpling, add a bit more flour to the dough and/or cook a bit longer with the dumplings in.\n\nThis is a very simple base recipe, so feel free to go wild with add-ons. Throw in some peas and carrots, or add some sage or oregano.\n\nThis recipe is insanely cheap and keeps and heats up well, so no wonder it's been a go-to for feeding the family for so long. I've gotten it well below $0.75 per serving, and even with chicken breast it doesn't creep too far above a buck a bowl. Plus clean-up is minimal since we basically just use one pot and one bowl.\n\n**BONUS RECIPE**\n\nThe dumpling recipe can be used exactly as is for drop biscuits so this recipe serves double duty. Whip up some dumplings, drop roughly golf ball sized balls onto a greased pan, and bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Top with melted butter, syrup, jam, or whatever you want.",

I promised to share this recipe after mentioning it with the biscuits, so here it is.\n\nI know I'll probably get flak for insisting on bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, but it's a hill I'm willing to die on. It is easily the most juicy and flavorful cut of chicken in my opinion, and the flavor really shines through in this dish. I like to eat the skin as well, but I understand a lot of people don't, so you can always take it out easily once the chicken begins to fall apart. Chicken thigh is very good for beginners also because it is so forgiving, especially for lower/slower recipes.\n\nIf you are avoiding them for health reasons and need to use breast meat, pay close attention to the heat and plan ahead for a shorter cook. It will still be tasty, just be careful not to get it too stringy and tacky."

Never learned to cook before. Now, I\u2019m often hungry because I don\u2019t have proper meals. I can do some stuff like boil an egg, make an oatmeal, boil pasta but nothing more than that. \n\nHow can I learn to cook? My father never cooks because \u201cit\u2019s women\u2019s job\u201d(I hate him) and my mother doesn\u2019t know how to cook and doesn\u2019t care that I don\u2019t have anything to eat. So my parents can\u2019t teach me to cook. I\u2019ve tried many recipes on YouTube or on internet but they failed. Pancakes and fried eggs end up sticking to the pan, rice end up being mushy. I\u2019ve even had food poisonings because I didn\u2019t know how to cook properly. I didn\u2019t know that beans need soaking and ate them almost raw. Also most of the meat I\u2019ve cooked was raw inside and that gave me food poisonings as well.\n\nThe foods I cook using YouTube or internet tutorial never work. The biscuit I tried to cook were very hard and impossible to bite, the cake I tried to cook 5 times even I tried different recipes never turned out eatable. And the soups I tried to cook tasted horribly but was eatable at least. Also there\u2019s always not enough ingredients at home and when I want to buy new ingredients my parents don\u2019t let me buy \n\nI find cooking very exhausting too, I try so hard and put a lot effort and in the end I end up with nothing but uneatable meal, dirty kitchen and dishes, wasting ingredients, my energy and many hours. Also then my parents scold me for wasting food. It\u2019s so much effort for nothing. And peeling potatoes are so difficult, I spend like 30 minutes peeling 3 potatoes. I don\u2019t even know how to peel potatoes.\n\nHow can I learn to cook? Do I need to go to cooking courses? I would like to go however there\u2019s pandemic and it also costs money and there\u2019s no one to drive me to a place where lessons take place. Please help me\n\nEdit: thank you so so much for your advice and help!!!!!! \n\nI live in Kazakhstan so things might be different here. Like fruits and vegetables are extremely expensive, 100 g berries cost 20 dollars and one avocado costs 10$ while an average broccoli costs about 5$. An average salary here is about 400$ so it\u2019s an extra issue",

[Here is a link to the video](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/12368-pan-seared-strip-steaks), but it is behind a paywall, so I will describe the process below. \n\nYou will need a well-marbled steak that is 1 & 1/2\" thick and a nonstick skillet. \n\nYes, a nonstick skillet. I was skeptical at first, but then I tried it and was quite surprised. \n\nSeason your steaks with salt & pepper, let them sit at room temp for at least 45 minutes, or up to 24 hours in the fridge. \n\nPat the steaks dry, add to the COLD nonstick pan. That's right, cold pan, and no oil. Insanity, I know. \n\nNow, turn the burner on full blast, set a timer for 2 minutes. Once the time is up, flip the steaks and reset the timer for 2 minutes. The steaks will be gray at this point. \n\nOnce that timer is up, flip the steaks and lower the heat to medium, and reset the timer to 2 minutes. You should now see the slightest bit of browning. \n\nNow you are going to leave the heat on medium for the rest of the process. Flip every 2 minutes, you should see a dark crust forming more and more with each flip. Start checking the internal temp when the crust starts looking good. By the time it reaches 120-130F, you should have a nice crust. You will start getting some smoke at this point, due to the rendered fat, but it won't be nearly as much as more traditional methods.\n\nLet them rest for 5-10 minutes. \n\nThis actually works. I suppose you could do this in a carbon steel or cast iron as well, but I don't think stainless steel would work well here, it would probably stick initially until that crust is built up. \n\nI am not saying this is superior to a hot sear, butter baste, or reverse sear, or anything like that, I'm just saying it works, and creates barely any smoke.",

Add enough condiments (I.e: mustard/mayo) to keep it moist \n6. Cut your vegetables right. Rarely is a romaine leaf a good addition. Thinly slice that, or better yet grab some ice burg. \n\nAdd some price:\n1. Better ingredients. Capicola. Soprisata. Other italian words I can\u2019t spell. Or easier ones - salami, pepperoni. Vary your meat. Most actual deli counters have the freshest meat with the most individual attention - it\u2019s hard to hit exactly, but doable. \n2. Better condiments!

You may find that you need more water or that you may need less depending on your kitchen environment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPinch off a roughly golfball-sized piece of the dough and roll it into a ball until smooth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLay out the cut ziplock bag and place the dough ball onto one side. Fold the other half of the bag to cover the dough. \n\nOptionally, you can lightly dust the bag with flour or spray with a non-stick spray.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlace the cutting board on top of the covered dough ball and press straight down slowly, using your body weight.\n\nContinue until the tortilla is at your preferred thickness, roughly 1/8 of an inch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCarefully peel off the top of the bag. Place one hand underneath the bag and tortilla and flip it onto your other hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGently peel off the second side the same as the first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlace the tortilla on a skillet set to medium high. Cook for about 1 minute and flip, cooking for an additional minute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemove and place on a towel-lined plate. As tortillas are cooked, place them in a stack on the plate and cover with the towel.\n\nCovering with the towel helps the tortillas steam with their residual heat, making them soft and pliable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTop with your favorite taco fillings and enjoy!",

Stale tortillas make for great tortilla chips (better than fresh ones imo). Just cut them up into chip-sized pieces and fry them at 350 or so until crispy, or spray with oil and bake at 425 for a few minutes. Season with salt while they are still hot and you have a perfect late-night snack.\n\n  \nSpeaking of making too many, I know this recipe may seem like a conservative amount of tortillas, but it's basically the perfect amount for my wife and I on taco night. The nice thing is that since the amounts are roughly 1-1-1, it's very easy to scale up and feed more folks.\n\nAs for what to put in your taco, I will forever sing the praises of Carnitas, or slow cooked pork shoulder (you may see this called boston butt as well). I'll make a full write-up at some point, but here's the quick rundown of my lazy version: Rub pork shoulder with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, and any other seasonings you enjoy. Place in a rimmed sheet and bake at 425-450 for until it develops a nice crust but isn't cooked inside, usually about 20 minutes. Toss it in a slow cooker on low with a bit of oil, or a pot set to medium-low heat, add enough broth (or water) to cover about 1/3 to 1/2 of it, add a bit more seasoning to the broth, cover with a lid, and leave for at least 3-4 hours. It's ready when the pork begins to fall apart with the twist of a fork."

        "selftext": "When people talk about improving a dish, they normally focus on seasoning. No complaints there. But after that, something often gets forgotten. That is, the addition of an acidic element.\n\nMy top tip for (inexpensively) improving any savoury dish - and some sweet - is to add an acid of your choice, primarily vinegar (and there are hundreds of variations) or citrus (lemon, lime, grapefruit, bergamot) or pickles. And when I say any savoury dish, I mean any and all of them.\n\nThis small adjustment is an absolute gamechanger. Salt gives flavour intensity. **Acid gives it dimension.**",

        "selftext": "Carnitas are incredible and I love making them the traditional way, which is to fry them and slow cook them in lard. However, sometimes I don't have lard on hand or easily available and let's be honest, I'm also very lazy. You can absolutely make this with sautee'd onions and garlic. You can for sure fry up the carnitas for a little extra texture. But you don't have to in order to have fall-apart, delicious pork. And if someone bullies you for using a basic recipe, let me know and I'll give them a stern talking-to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlow Cooker Carnitas\n\nIngredients:\n\n\\- 3-5 Pounds pork shoulder, cut into a few chunks\n\n\\- 3 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil\n\n\\- 6-8 ounces Mexican Coke (the kind you drink)\\*\n\n\\- 2 tablespoons citrus juice (orange, lime, or lemon)\n\n\\- 2 teaspoons garlic powder (or 6 cloves of crushed fresh garlic)\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground Cumin\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Chile Powder\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons Onion Powder\n\n\\- 1 teaspoon dried Oregano\n\n\\- 4 teaspoons salt\n\n\\- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper\n\n\t\\*Be sure it's the kind with Cane Sugar, not Corn Syrup. If needed, sub in broth\n\nInstructions:\n\n\\- Divide pork shoulder into chunks so that it can fit into your slow cooker or pot.\n\n\\- Coat the bottom of the pot with oil and toss in the pork shoulder. Spread remaining oil over the meat to coat evenly. Generously add seasonings, mixing and rubbing as you go, until all of the meat is covered.\n\n\\- Mix in the citrus and Mexican Coke (or broth). The meat should be about halfway covered.\n\n\\- Cook on low for about 6 hours, or high for about 3 hours until the pork easily shreds.\n\n\\- Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\\- This is the lazy version. If you feel sassy and want to take them up a notch, roast the pork (before slow cooking) at 450f in a high-rimmed baking sheet (it will release a lot of juices) for 15-20 minutes, or until it's developed a browned crust. Then add the pork along with the juices into the slow cooker or pot.\n\n\\- Another option is to quickly pan fry the pork after it finishes cooking. And I mean quickly, otherwise you'll lose all of that tenderness you put in all that work for. Well, not physical work, this is super easy. I mean the work it takes to smell it cooking all day and refrain from digging in early.",

Once they were unfroze they were mushy mush! I didn't understand where I went wrong until i googled.\n\nTurns out the high water content in cooked potatoes makes them turn into goo when you freeze/unfreeze them.\n\nSo learn from my mistake and don't ruin a batch of potatoes!\n\nMaybe this is common knowledge to most, but for a beginner cook like myself I had to learn the hard way...\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nthanks for all the tips guys! Wish I consulted this sub first before ruining my potatoes. Good to know they can be frozen with the right prep and if used right away. Thank you!",

Cooks Illustrated did an [experiment](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/6581-blooming-in-oil-for-flavor) where they found up to 10x more flavor compounds when spices and herbs were steep in oil than fat. So cool, right?!\n\nPlus fat is magical. It carries flavor and permeates it throughout the dish. This is especially great for whole spices, like fennel seeds, where you can taste the fennel even if you never have a bite with fennel seeds in it.\n\nSo always give your spices a chance to \"bloom\" directly in fat for 30 seconds. Whether that is with onions, carrots, and celery that you've been sauteing for a soup or ground beef you're browning in a pan for bolognese, add your spices before your liquid. That extra time with the fat will boost the flavor of your dish!\n\nYou'll smell the difference :)\n\n*If you like cooking tips like this, I share others like it in a weekly email newsletter called* [*Salt Sear Savor*](https://www.saltsearsavor.com)*.",

        "selftext": "As well as being delicious, this cr\u00eape batter is superior to other batters because you don't need to let it rest before making cr\u00eapes and you don't need to butter the pan between each cr\u00eape.\n\nIf you're interested, I've made a whole video on the history of Candlemas and how to make cr\u00eapes, which you can checkout here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg)\n\nOtherwise, here is the recipe.\n\nFor 24 cr\u00eapes, you will need:\n\n\\- 250g of Flour (0.55 lbs)\n\n\\- 60g of Butter (2.1 oz)\n\n\\- 5g of Salt (0.2oz)\n\n\\- 6 Whole Eggs\n\n\\- 600ml of Milk (2.5 cups)\n\n\\- 4tbsp of Water\n\n\\- 4tsp of a Strong Liquor (such as Cognac or a Dark Rum)\n\n(The original recipe asked for twice as much salt but that was too much. If the cr\u00eapes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)\n\n1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.\n2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.\n3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.\n\nVoil\u00e0! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr\u00eapes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.\n\nTo make a nice cr\u00eape, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr\u00eape. When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.\n\nLet the cr\u00eape cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr\u00eape sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.\n\nAs a topping, I strongly recommend trying out \"Cr\u00e8me de Marron\" or brown sugar with lemon.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit!\n\nI really hope you give these a try. They are tasty, easy and fun to make and you can put any toppings you like on them so it's really a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.",

                "body": "I have been looking for a quick no hassle pizza recipe and I've become addicted to this Mediterranean inspired pizza ever since creating it a few weeks ago.  Here's why its great for beginners:\n\n1. **Easy dough recipe** \\- Don't be daunted if you have not made dough before, this one is hard to mess up! It uses a naan style dough recipe (yogurt in the dough) and there is no stand mixer required. All you have to do is stir everything into a ball, knead it a few times, let it rise and then roll it out. Also, **you can make the dough ahead of time, store it in the fridge and break off a chunk and roll it out when you are ready to cook!**\n2. **Fast cooking time** \\- Once you have all your toppings ready and dough ready, **it takes less than 5 minutes**.  It's 1 minute on each side in a pan on the stove top to cook the dough, and then you crisp everything up in the broiler for 2-3 minutes.\n3. **No need to cook or buy a sauce** \\-  This kind of goes with #4, but for this version I use **a harissa paste and Skyr dressing base (which may sound weird but its amazing).** You could use just plain olive oil, bbq sauce, hot sauce, tomatoes, literally anything that could resemble a sauce base.\n4. **Endless topping substitutions** \\- **This recipe is really just a blueprint for easy and quick pizza.** If you don't like what I have listed for toppings this can be done with about anything you have in the fridge (trust me, even weird combinations come out good). **I've done Mexican inspired, BBQ chicken, cheeseburger, classic Italian, endless possibilities!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Original video recipe to follow along](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CU1oj_tEAM)!\n\n[Bonus close up picture.](https://imgur.com/a/UBA8rce)\n\nAnother pro to a damn fine pizza? *It's quite healthy too* (depending on your goals). One pizza comes in around 630 calories and 50 grams of protein!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# - RECIPE -\n\n# Naan Style Pizza Dough\n\n***Ingredients:***\n\n* 2.5 cups bread flour (reserve \u00bc to \u00bd cup for dusting)\n* \u00bd cup Siggi\u2019s 0% plain skyr\n* 1 cup warm water\n* 1 TBSP yeast\n* Olive oil for cooking (about 2 TSP per naan)\n\n***Method:***\n\nMix the warm water, skyr and yeast in a measuring cup or bowl. **Let the yeast bloom for 5 minutes until there are visible bubbles on top.**\n\nIn a mixing bowl, add 1.25 cups of flour to the water, skyr, and yeast. Stir until a very sticky mass forms. Gradually add the remaining .75-1 cup of flour until a shaggy dough ball forms.\n\nKnead the dough in the bowl until it pulls away from the side. Cover and let rest until the dough doubles in size (around 90 minutes). **Note: Dough can be stored in the fridge overnight or for a couple of days before cooking.**\n\nTurn dough onto a floured counter and knead 10-15 times. Cut the dough into 6-8 rounds (depending on size preference). Roll out each round until it is very thin, about 1/8 inch thick.\n\n**TO ASSEMBLE AND COOK PIZZA:** Drizzle 1 TSP of olive on one side. Put the olive oil side down in a ripping hot pan (medium high heat) and cover for 1 minute until bubbles form.\n\nTurn the heat down to low. Drizzle 1 TSP olive oil on the other side and flip. Add the toppings below and throw into the broiler on high for 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly. Top with fresh dill!\n\n# Toppings & Sauce\n\n***Sauce:***\n\n* 1/4 cup Siggi\u2019s 0% plain skyr\n* 1 TSP of Harissa (I used Trader Joes)\n\n***Method:*** Mix Siggi\u2019s and Harissa in a bowl until combined.\n\n***Protein:***\n\n* \u00bd pound Ground Bison (Or any other protein - only use 1/4 pound as topping)\n* Salt & Pepper to Taste\n* 2 TSP spice mix (**1 TBSP Cumin, 1 TSP Smoked Paprika, \u00bd TSP Cloves, \u00bd TSP Cinnamon**)\n\n***Method:***\n\nMix bison and spice mix, and brown the meat in a medium heat pan.\n\n***Other Toppings:***\n\n* \u00bc cup sliced Onions\n* \u00bd cup shredded Mozzarella\n* 1 TBSP Fresh Dill (Don't skip the dill!)\n\nEnjoy!"
