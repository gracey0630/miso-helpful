It seems like everybody has years and years and years left, right up until they don't.\n\n**Edit**\n\nIt turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen. \n\nI've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have *some* idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea. \n\nGo home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.\n\n**Edit**\nThis outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined!

The internet which is the very definition of \"not permanent stuff\" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.\n\nPlease note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be.

And a lot of self-help advice requires more energy and motivation than people with depression actually have.\n\nSo, I actually went and did it. I've made a blog dedicated to NOT cooking. It's called *\"Fuck It, I'm Not Cooking\"*.\n\nNothing I ever post will take more than five minutes to make, nor require any more preparation than chopping things and wrapping a tortilla. All of it's cheap and healthy, or healthy as long as you don't overdo the condiments. I've made a \"master shopping list\" so you only have to shop once a week, don't waste much food, and should be able to carry it all home if you don't have a car. Everything's inexpensive and easy to find in the supermarket. There'll be both sweet and savoury recipes, snacks, and healthy alternatives to cravings for crappy food. \n\nBasically, it's supposed to be as much/less effort than your usual depression eating, taste good, and be way better for you.\n\nI've spent all day setting it up, from tomorrow there will be recipes daily. So far, I've posted a few super basic recipes in with the Master Shopping List. \n\nHere's the main page: https://missmedlandtaylor.com/fuckcooking/\n\n[Here's some commentary on how and why I made it](https://missmedlandtaylor.com/2017/10/19/the-story-behind-fuck-it-im-bad-at-cooking/)\n\n[Here's the Master Shopping List, with bonus \"Master\" recipes](https://missmedlandtaylor.com/2017/10/19/the-master-shopping-list-with-some-basic-master-recipes/)\n\n\nIf you want to follow it via email, you can do it at the bottom of the webpage. It's super, super easy to do, and then it'll be sent to you and you won't have to actively keep up to date.\n\n(Cross-posted from r/eatcheapandhealthy)",

        "title": "For the love of god, please stop bashing American Chinese food as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\" [Rant]",
        "selftext": "As a second gen Chinese American myself, I am really tired of people being a complete snob over authenticity to the point that they distort the history and culture behind Chinese cuisine.\n\nI've had enough of people trashing American Chinese food as \"not the real thing\" or even worse, \"Chinese food dumbed down for American people\" (like WTF?!)\n\nWhile I don't deny that Chinese food in America is different from Chinese food on the mainland, that  doesn't make it any less worthy. Sure, it has been changed to some extent to suit local palates, but that's pretty much the same thing with Chinese food in the diaspora in general. There is also Indonesian Chinese, Filipino Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, and even Peruvian Chinese  food-yet nobody calls these variants as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\". \n\nMoreover, people had to make adaptations to the cuisine anyways in the new land due to the lack of available ingredients that they usually had back home.  No Chinese broccoli? Use western broccoli instead. \n\n One has to remember that Chinese cuisine is by no means a monolith- it's pretty diverse with a lot of regional variations-hence Beijing cuisine is different from Shanghai cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. A lot of early Chinese immigrants to the US were from the Guangdong province, hence American Chinese food is heavily based on the cuisine from that area (albeit still a limited representation).  This is the reason why later immigrants from other parts of China might find American Chinese cuisine to be strange and completely foreign. \n\nI always have to chuckle whenever someone tries hard to demonstrate what \"authentic\" and \"inauthentic\" Chinese food is by comparing a Chinese takeout dish with Cantonese origins (ie, chow mein or orange chicken) to a dish from another region in China, which is essentially comparing apples to oranges. A good example would be this [Buzzfeed video](https://youtu.be/8vMOESJwWsg) in which the host claims to try \"authentic\" sweet and sour pork for the first time, when in reality the version that she tried is no less \"authentic\" than the one she is used to. Only difference is that the so-called \"authentic\" version is another regional variation, just like the Cantonese-style sweet and sour pork many are familiar with. \n\nWhile I do appreciate people willing to take a deeper look into Chinese cuisine beyond the menu at the local takeout, there's no need to be an utter snob about it. Food is food, peeps. It's high time that we recognize American Chinese cuisine as something unique of its own.\n\nEDIT: Holy smokes this thread did blow up unexpectedly. I'm seeing a lot of amazing input from various perspectives. Here are a few additional things I want to add\n\n1) While I did mention American Chinese food in the post and title, I was also referring to Chinese food in the western diaspora in general (including Canadian Chinese food, British Chinese food, etc.) \n\n2) Regarding authenticity, yes it is something that does exist, though at the same time it is something that is very subjective. Given the insanely diverse array of Chinese cuisine, it would be disingenuous to pinpoint \"authenticity\" as solely one way of cooking. There's no such thing as \"this is the only way to do it right\". Take Kung Pao chicken for example. While the original version in Sichuan is hot and spicy, there are also other regional versions in China that are less spicy. \n\n3) Some of y'all also talked about how some people bash American/Western Chinese food out of an identity crisis- this especially rings true for a lot of second gen Chinese Americans grappling between two cultures. On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu. A much as I detest the culinary gatekeeping sentiment, I can definitely see where it's coming from. \n\n4) I also find it interesting how a lot of people think of American Chinese food as generally heavy on the grease, starch and sugar. While I do get it's kinda explainable given that general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and orange chicken are some of the most popular American Chinese dishes, there's also way more to that as well. Heck, even American Chinese cuisine can be vast and diverse! Of course there's also a lot of less greasy, less sugary foods like moo goo gai pan and moo shoo pork. However in my state, Louisiana, there's also yakmein and crawfish fried rice. Let's bring on the goodness!",

For example, is a recording of an Indian raga \u201cinauthentic\u201d because the musicians used a violin, which isn\u2019t native to India.\n\nIn the midst of one of these debates, a prof posted this story. He\u2019d served in Iran in the Peace Corps in the 1970s, and had the most amazing kebabs while he was there. He\u2019d never been able to replicate them, though, even though he tried every Persian recipe he could find. So one time he\u2019s at a street fair in LA and finds a Persian guy selling kebabs and it\u2019s the same recipe! He badgers the guy to tell him the recipe, and the guy says, \u201cOh sure! Very traditional Persian recipe\u2014handed down in my family for years. First, you\u2019ll need some 7-Up for the marinade...\u201d\n\nPeople love to get snobby over \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d. There\u2019s probably something there about us Americans feeling unrooted, culturally, because our history doesn\u2019t go back as far, maybe? The only time I think there\u2019s value in the \u201ctraditional\u201d argument is when people reduce a culture\u2019s food to what they\u2019ve been exposed to\u2014like thinking Panda Express is all there is to Chinese cuisine and acting surprised when you go to Shanghai and don\u2019t see stuff you recognize on the menu. And that\u2019s more about recognizing the world is a bigger place than your backyard. :)\n\n**Edit:** Forgot I was on /r/cooking here, so of course people would want the recipe in question! This was 2003-2004, but I'm willing to bet the ethnomusicology list she was on has email archives, so I'm putting on my safari hat and delving into the search. I'll post back here if I find it!\n\n**Second Edit:** Well, rats. The list does have archives but is closed to musicologists only so they\u2019re not searchable. I\u2019ll keep looking, but I\u2019m not optimistic."

Probably the fucking marketing, but they were on the shelf, dried, in a small plastic bag touting the wonderful properties of beans.  She bought them at a bean store in San Francisco.  Only in SF could there be a fucking bean store during a pandemic.  Great fanfare was made over this package of beans.\n\nWe soaked them for like an hour, tossed them in when we\u2019d normally toss in the can of beans.  Cooked another 15 minutes, and served.  They were\u2026 crunchy, but the broth flavor was really good, so we figured \u201cmeh, eat this bowl, let it keep cooking.\u201d  Kinda like slightly undercooked rice, you know?\n\nI did not know.\n\nMy wife\u2019s sister went first.  There was unexplained running during a movie.\n\nMy wife went second.  Two down.\n\nI\u2019m now sitting on the couch by myself with the pets listening to my brother in law make pterodactyl noises with distant cough/vomit sounds in the background from my wife and sister-in-law like a gross harmony.\n\nWe\u2019re out of toilets to puke in.  I\u2019m feeling about a 7/10.  I have yet to determine if time is a friend or an enemy for me tonight.\n\nTurns out, dried beans need to be soaked for 5 hours, then boiled, and always eaten very tender.\n\nThank you for this final lesson 2021.  \u201cPurging the past\u201d jokes are being received poorly by all those involved.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s 9:30 here.

        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps\n\n#What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf \"and everything that goes with it!\").\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n#What's the plan? \n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\nWhat can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord- but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.\n\n3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.",

        "selftext": "Went into a store and the cheese display had a quarter wheel of parm. The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???\n\nTLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?\n\nEdit: photos https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy\n\nEdit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.\n\nEdit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked \"anything else?\" I made a joke about \"not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!\" She said \"bring it over!\" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars. As multiple people have stated in the comments, NY has a law that requires stores to sell their merchandise at the labeled price.\n\nEdit 4: It is not an old banana, it is a plantain not yet ready for maduros",

I love being master egg scrambler. \n\nMy other one: through no fault of my own, everyone thinks I make great from scratch brownies. It\u2019s just a mix. I\u2019m in too deep. I can\u2019t reveal it now.\n\nEDIT: I told my boyfriend about the butter. He jokingly screamed \u201cHOW COULD YOU!?\u201d And stormed into the other room. Then he came back and said, \u201cyeah butter makes everything good so that makes sense.\u201d No more secrets here!\n\nEDIT 2: I have read as many responses as I can and the consensus is:\n\n- MSG MSG MSG. MSG isn\u2019t bad for you and makes food delish. \n\n- Butter. Put butter in everything. And if you\u2019re baking? Brown your butter!!!!\n\n- Cinnamon: it\u2019s not just for sweet recipes. \n\n- Lots of love for pickle juice. \n\n- A lot of y\u2019all are taking the Semi Homemade with Sandra Lee approach and modifying mixes/pre-made stuff and I think that\u2019s a great life hack in general. Way to be resourceful and use what you have access to to make things tasty and enjoyable for the people in your life! \n\n- Shocking number of people get praise for simply properly seasoning food. This shouldn\u2019t be a secret. Use enough salt, guys. It\u2019s not there to hide the flavor, it\u2019s there to amplify it. \n\n\nI\u2019ve saved quite a few comments with tips or recipes to try later on. Thanks for all the participation! It\u2019s so cool to hear how so many people have \u201cspecialities\u201d and it\u2019s really not too hard to take something regular and make it your own with experimentation.

It is remarkable how consistently the rice makes fluffy, Al dente grains. I\u2019ve seen countless images of stovetop rice turning out mushy because messing up is so easy. Or maybe some stovetop users don\u2019t know what rice should taste like. Also you don\u2019t need butter, fat is just not necessary for rice and extra calories. Last thing is that it\u2019s dishwasher safe and no risk of the rice sticking like it can with a regular pan. \n\nI\u2019m gonna throw a rice cooker use recipe that you can make every weeknight: Thai curry. Just mix store bought curry paste with coconut milk, add any veggies and proteins, and serve over rice. Trust me, making rice from the rice cooker will also make it survive being drenched in hot sauces when some stovetop rices won\u2019t. \n\nI really promise that putting 20 dollars aside for a rice cooker will be one the best culinary decisions of your life. So many healthy, easy, weeknight recipes can be made. So just please, make the investment. ",

They're leaving sad, barely-touched meat discs on their plates. My boys have opinions, and they're brutal: 'weird,' 'too dry,' 'too oily,' 'too greasy,' and the soul-crushing 'it doesn't have any taste.'\n\nTo me, they've always been rather plain, but that seemingly was never a problem before. Something has changed, though I'm not sure what.\n\nI'm using 80/20 ground beef, fresh as can be, from a decent grocery store in Massachusetts (Shaw's). My wife likes hers still mooing, but the boys want theirs perma-charred - no pink allowed.\n\nCurrent recipe (use at your own risk): 7 oz of beef, manhandled into submission, flattened, and sacrificed to a medium-high skillet for 4 minutes per side. Cheese gets a 60-second cameo at the end. Brioche buns because I really do try to make my fam happy.\n\nI've never had to season ground beef before, but maybe that's where I've gone wrong? Is there a secret burger society I'm not privy to? A bovine illuminati?\n\nI could use some help.

I said MSG crystals because they genuinely are essential in Chinese cooking. I got downvoted for it which doesn't bother me apart from the fact that this is a cooking sub and debunked racist conspiracy theories shouldn't really have a place here.\n\nIt genuinely did start with a hoax, it s complete bullshit. I am going to hope (probably in vain) that the idiots will read the links as I'm not going to do their homework for them but I know they won't.\n\nI'm writing this for the idiots, so I'm discounting the fact that most of you vaguely intelligent people realise that glutamates are naturally present in a hell of a lot of food (apologies again for the rant), let's just imagine for a minute that tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms and meat don't contain glutamates. I mean they do and all you sufferers eat this stuff all the time but the minute it's a little Chinese tasting you have a reaction.\n\nIt's a genuinely ingrained racist reaction and you should as members of cooking sub that celebrates cuisine from all over the world be disgusted with yourselves (talking to the idiots again).\n\nMSG is a fantastic additive that everybody should have in their kitchen, it is no different from adding a pinch of salt to your cooking, not just Chinese food, it adds a depth to tomato sauces, cheese sauces, fried chicken. It truly is fantastic stuff.\n\nAnyway, as I said, apologies for the rant, I'm sure most of you understand the benefits of it, this is just for the small coterie of idiots that still cling to this ridiculous theory. \n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14119082-400-science-why-msg-myth-is-a-load-of-chop-suey/#:~:text=Chinese%20restaurant%20syndrome%20was%20born%20in%20April%201968,experienced%20whenever%20he%20ate%20at%20a%20Chinese%20restaurant.\n\nhttps://news.colgate.edu/magazine/2019/02/06/the-strange-case-of-dr-ho-man-kwok/",

I tried Beyond Meat at a fast food place and it tasted like an overseasoned paste that left regret on my tongue for the rest of the day. \n\nVegetarian foods in America try to replace meat. MorningStar is never going to replace a prime rib with black beans. But it won't stop them from trying.\nThis is in direct contrast with asian foods (the other half of my heritage). Where vegetable dishes seem integrated into cultural norms. Hinduism and Indian food for instance. Or Thai foods, Chinese foods have vegetables take up the entire dish. These foods also are heavily influenced by auxiliary tastes. Instead of the beef talking, its aromatic spices and insanely hot peppers.\n\nI'm making sweeping generalizations. But I wonder if it's possible to create foods that are not simply lesser imitations of what you really want (fake chicken nuggies) but a mainstay dish. And if it is possible to make it simple enough for an American pallette and accessible to cooks who don't have much time. Maybe there are and I don't know about them.\n\nTL;DR Is it possible to create true vegetable focused dishes in the USA that arent trying to replace meat as the star of any given meal.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your thoughtful replies and rewards. I'll try to get to your comments!\n\nEdit 2: I want to say I do not think that vegetarians are trying to substitute meat for everything.

They had meat, but not every day; most meals were a plate full of 5 or 6 hearty vegetables, augmented by cornbread, biscuits or hush puppies, and often a fruit-based dessert like apple turnovers or pumpkin pie. And each of those vegetables was a delicious dish - fried green tomatoes (it's a beloved real dish, not just a movie), stewed green beans & eggplant, corn pudding, whatever came out of the garden that day. This was simple farm food, and a way of life throughout their community. There are hundreds of such dishes, based on real whole food, throughout the U.S. and the whole world, not just Asia.\n\nWhat is stuck in American cuisine is the British template for \"meat and two veg\" - the idea that there is one big entree of something, and a couple of sides. That's still seen as a norm and as long as that is so, companies will attempt to replicate it, but without the meat. But it's not necessary, as your friend demonstrated."

Like, \u00abyou stole our spices and now you butcher our food\u00bb. But I think people are judging him on the wrong premise. I don\u2019t think making authentic dishes has ever been his point. Most people in the UK are very normal working class people with poor diets. Whose worlds are their local communities, and they do what they can to get by. And these normal, busy people are Oliver\u2019s target group. He\u2019s a champion when it comes to public health, and his goal is to get the public to make their own food and eat healthier. For them, chilli jam and soy sauce is probably exotic enough. So adding soy sauce to a dish makes it \u00abAsian\u00bb. Because that\u2019s how it is to the people he\u2019s speaking to. Had he gone full authentic, it wouldn\u2019t have served the purpose at all, as nobody would have bothered. His shows aren\u2019t meant for British Asians with a strong knowledge of the cuisine of their country of origin. And I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s offensive or wrong.\n\nI\u2019m a massive foodie, and I would never go to Jamie if I wanted to learn how to make for example pad thai. Cause his recipes aren\u2019t meant for that, they\u2019re not meant for foodies who want to spend an entire Saturday making the perfect dandan noodles *just* as the locals do it.\n\nI just came across an episode of Gogglebox where a Jamie Oliver show was on, and I think the gogglers\u2019 reactions speak for themselves.

Something about the umami. My friends have been trying to figure out my \"secret ingredient\" for years.\n\nLastly, using a hair dryer on chicken skin before roasting.

Got out my digital scale, put on my mixing bowl, tared (zeroed) off the weight.  Added flour, tared, added salt, tared, added yeast, tared, added water.  Mixed everything by hand.  Ended up with NO EXTRA dirty dishes!  No cups, no teaspoons.  Nothing.\n\nHonestly, the rest of the world knows already this. I have a medical degree, so metric is second nature (it's what the scientific world already uses).

The house smells great. I will never forget you onions out there. \n\nUpdate 2: After doing a majority of the cooking in the instant pot outside, the onions are now on my stove. Luckily I just got a new range hood less than a week ago so that's on full blast. Guess what we've decided to include in dinner tonight? Hint: it's onion rings.\n\nUpdate: Day 2 is upon us. I just finished cutting up about 8 quarts of onions. I have an instant pot coming up to pressure on my porch as we speak. A fan is blowing in the direction of my cutting station to the window. I immediately washed all my cutting equipment  and wiped the counters with a mix of dish soap, water, and lemon essential oil. I promise I\u2019m not a crazy essential oil lady, I just like the smell and it makes a good cheap all-purpose cleaner. See you all in about 2 onions for another update?\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for their suggestions. I have decided to postpone the onion marathon until tomorrow due to me being drugged up on Benadryl and not wanting to enter an onion-induced coma. Tomorrow is a new onion. Wish me onion. Onion.",

On the very first page was a chicken stew recipe I\u2019d heard my mom talk about many times. She always said how much she loved it growing up, and how my grandma used to make it all the time. So I thought, what better way to surprise her?\n\nThe recipe called for a lot of garlic way more than I was used to and at first I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a mistake. But I didn\u2019t want to change anything. I followed it exactly, down to the instruction that said not to add salt until the chicken fat began to rise and impurities could be skimmed off. It felt like I was learning more than just a recipe and more like how my grandma used to cook.\n\nWhen I served it, my mom didn\u2019t know I had followed that specific recipe. But as soon as she smelled it, she froze. She looked at me, confused, then smiled softly. I watched as her eyes welled up with tears. She didn\u2019t even need to say anything, I knew that smell had brought her back.\n\nI broke down too, not gonna lie. It was one of those rare moments where food becomes something so much more than food.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this moment with you all. It reminded me why I love cooking, and how powerful a recipe can be. Can\u2019t wait to hear your experiences \ud83e\udef6",

Well, I accidentally burned the onions and garlic. Only slightly \u2014 not too much \u2014 but definitely just enough to be noticeable.\n\nThe cheapskate that I am, instead of tossing it and starting over as I should have, I rolled with it... which turned out to be a big mistake. The bitterness was definitely there.\n\nPanicked, I looked online, and learned that apparently, lemon juice *can* offset some of such bitterness. Desperate, I added just about a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and simmered it on low for a bit longer than I usually would.\n\n*It worked.*\n\nWhen I tasted it once it was finished, I couldn\u2019t believe it. The bitterness was gone. My husband, unaware of the situation, happily ate it without noticing anything unusual. I even asked afterwards, and he insisted it tasted just as it usually does.\n\nSo, lemon juice\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I now respect you in hearty recipes, not just in fresh ones or in tea.

Inspectors would no longer be required to examine the first 300 birds of each flock for signs of the disease, and processors would be able to cut off tumors and lesions and then process the rest of the bird. The approval has led to a proposed rule change that is now before the food safety administrator Paul Kiecker.\n\n>Here\u2019s what we know about Avian Leukosis: A small percentage of birds (less than 1%) are diagnosed with the virus each year, but it spreads quickly through flocks and tens of thousands of chickens are condemned annually due to exposure. While it\u2019s unlikely that the virus could transfer from chickens to humans, it\u2019s not impossible. There is some evidence that workers exposed to birds infected with the disease in the U.K. have developed antibodies, indicating a transfer of the virus from animal to human.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-11/diseased-chicken-for-dinner-the-usda-is-considering-it?fbclid=IwAR2iBPSwV1UtufkTK1s-XoXoZmZBd4xHccTpodLXqWC_dOaVY0_1-46ACEQ",

And even then, if all you can afford are dollar store spices, that's ok, it still works, and really, it doesn't make thaaaat much of a difference. Add some acid and salt and you're good to go.\n\nEdit: the snobbery of saying only food using fresh ground spices is good is what I'm taking issue with. Not everyone can afford a blender or coffee grinder, or even have the space for it.  Cooking should be accessible to Every One.

You shouldn't look down on anyone because they cant/don't use the bestest most expensive rare ingredients and tools. And honestly, 95% of people don't know shit when it comes to food. \nIf your barometer of a good recipe is whether they use fresh ground spices or not, then you should have enough skill to figure out how to make the switch.\nAlso, not everyone on reddit has a penis.\n\nEdit3: thank you for the awards, I find it silly.

In general, due to the order I assume this means \"Get 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves then chop them\" but there is a big difference between \"1/2 packed cups\" and \"1/2 loose cups\".\n\nI know not everyone has a scale (especially a sensitive scale) but why can't we just say \"1 medium onion (about 1 cup or 100 grams)\"( no idea if that is a good conversion or not just using a example).\n\nFor the most part, it probably doesn't matter but sometimes I really would like to have a weight so I can just tare the scale and start adding the next thing.\n\nEdit: I feel the need to clarify 2 points:\n\n1. I'm mostly talking about in \"professional\" recipes (i.e. ones that people are paid to write). If you post something on reddit/your blog I don't really mind (and I don't mind overall to be honest it's mostly an annoyance).\n2. I'm not advocating dropping volumes. I'm just advocating adding weights as well. MANY recipes already do this in reverse (i.e. 4 ounces parmesan, grated (About 2 cups)) so if something is not well suited for volume it would be nice to have weight as well.",

        "selftext": "Update: You guys are crazy about this story i can\u2019t answer to you all but thanks you so much for the help, and recipes you shared with me \u2764\ufe0f  I came clean to my boyfriend & he thinks it\u2019s funny. So I\u2019ve decided to tell the truth to my friends once I baked a great replacement recipe to give them as a make-up. They won\u2019t buy the Alsa batter mix because of the palm oil in it, and I shouldn\u2019t either tbh.. I\u2019ll keep you updated in the cooking sub \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nI\u2019ve really dug myself into a hole. It all started at this event where we were supposed to bring a cake. I had totally forgotten, didn\u2019t have time, so I grabbed one of those ready made cake mixes, like Alsa (maybe its a French brand idk ). Of course, I didn\u2019t dare admit it was just a box mix(edit not a box mix, but a already made batter) , since the whole idea was to bring something \u201chomemade\u201d\u2026 But then the cake was such a hit. Like, such a hit that ever since, people keep asking me to make my \u201cfamous\u201d chocolate cake for every birthday, every party\u2026 \nThis has been going on for years now. Everyone keeps begging me for the recipe, and I\u2019ve tried a million times to recreate it with recipes I find online, but the result is always so disappointing compared to that cursed mix. And now my friends are getting annoyed at me for not sharing the recipe, cause I keep saying I will.\nSo please, I need help figuring out how to reproduce this chocolate cake. On top of everything, the mix is ridiculously expensive, and I\u2019m tired of wasting money and lying to my friends!\n\n\u00c9dit3: here is the actual list of ingredients \nIngredients: Palm oil, EGG 21%, sugar, cocoa powder 18% (sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa and low-fat cocoa powder, natural vanilla flavor), WHEAT flour 10.3%, a stabilizer (glycerol), powdered CREAM, powdered EGG white, a pinch of raising agents (diphosphates and sodium carbonates), a little salt, and a preservative (E202).\n\nEdit2: it\u2019s actually not a box mix, my translation isn\u2019t the best. It\u2019s a pre-made batter ready to be put in cake mold and int the oven. Not my video but here\u2019s what it\u2019s look like https://www.tiktok.com/@lesdelicesdemaryam/video/7397920950995488032\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m French and very few people actually uses ready to bake mix. Everybody ate really healthy and nothing pre-made, I think that\u2019s why no one recognised my fake cake and liked it so much. It really is tastier than any chocolate cake I tasted. I\u2019m also sick of eating this unhealthy mix, so if you have a recipe that tastes the same I\u2019ll be eternally grateful \ud83d\ude4f (on the package there\u2019s a lot of bullshit in the ingredients and no info for the amount so I can\u2019t really copy that)",

Bland food genuinely upsets me now and I look down upon people who have not been 'awakened' to the point that I have had arguments.\n\nI talk about hot sauce in my sleep. I fight strangers in the street.\n\n Last night, making love to my wife, in the moment of climax instead of screaming her name I screamed out  'HOT SAAAUUUCE'.

It's zesty, spicy and full of bright herbs. Here ya go:\n\n\nMoroccan Veggie Marinade\n\n1/4 c olive oil\n\n1/4 c lime juice \n\n3-4 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 tsp ground coriander\n\n1/2 tsp ground cumin\n\n1 tsp paprika\n\n1 tsp chili powder\n\n1/2 tbsp salt (I use flaked kosher)\n\n1/2 tbsp ground black pepper\n\nFresh cilantro and mint to taste, chopped fine.\n\n\nWhisk all ingredients together thoroughly, toss with vegetables (I use hunks of bell pepper, zucchini, red onion, and brown mushrooms for the kebabs, tastes amazing!). Marinade for at least one hour before grilling, though 3-4 hrs is best. You can use leftover marinade to brush on the kebabs while grilling.\n\nHope somebody here can get some tasty use from it, defs gonna try out a bunch of ideas on this thread. Thanks for all the ideas!\n\nEdit:  Wow, thanks so much for the upvotes and awards guys, wasn't expecting this to get so much love haha. Glad my recipe could be of use to you guys!"

It was so much worse-- it tasted off and no improvement in crispiness.  I saw so many chefs (looking at you, Bon Appetit) doing it and swearing by it that I was convinced I might have messed it up the first time and should try again.  Nope, same result!\n\nThis is a classic \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  A grilled cheese was always perfect-- there is no hack or improvement to this platonic ideal of crispy, buttery bread breaking through to the warm lava flow of melty cheese.  The butter is an essential element, giving the nuttiness of it browning in the skillet and perfect texture.  Go ahead and riff on it with all the combinations and additions all you like, making delicious melts of all varieties, but don't change the core elements: bread, cheese, and BUTTER.  Sometimes we need to realize \"oh right, it's been done this way forever because we figured out it's perfect like this\" (this applies to a lot of kitchen gadgets too, when the basic tools + basic practice and understanding are so much better).",

So, obviously I was hyper vigilant about it. Strained my stock and set it in the pan to one side to cool. Next time I go into the kitchen the pot is empty. How thoughtful, he must have put it in the fridge. No, he poured it down the drain claiming he thought it was dirty dish water, like a pot left to soak.
