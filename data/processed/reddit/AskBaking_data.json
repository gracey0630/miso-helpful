        "title": "60+ year old \"fudge pie\" recipe doesn't work anymore. Can anyone think of why?",
        "selftext": "This recipe has been a staple at Thanksgiving for at least 60 years. My mom grew up making it, I grew up making it. My grandma taught us the recipe.\n\nThe recipe is very much a grandma recipe.\n\n>Fudge Pie\n>1/2 stick butter\n>2 eggs\n>1/2 cup evaporated milk\n>1 1/2 cup sugar\n>3 tbsp cocoa\n>vanilla\n>Stir ingredients,  do not beat. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\n\n\nThe way we used to make it was to stir everything together then cut the butter in to small bits and sprinkle on top. It would bake, and be a delicious pie that was like a custard texture that tasted like a brownie with a crunchy top. The amount of vanilla is one cap full.\n\n\nThen, probably about 15-20 years ago it took the pie 45 minutes to bake right. About 10 years ago we can't get it to set. We used to be able to cut into while still warm, and it was set. If we try that now, it's chocolate soup. Delicious, but completely soup. The top looks like it should, but it's not set. Even if we let it cool, it doesn't set. We can leave it in the oven until the crust is black, and it is still soup.\n\nThe method hasn't changed so that makes me think something about the ingredients has changed. I know eggs have gotten larger. I have tried 1 egg, I have tried medium eggs. It still doesn't work. The closest I can get is with medium eggs, but the pie has to be refrigerated before it will set. Now I can't even find medium eggs in the stores anymore. The pie never needed to be cooled to set until relatively recently. \n\nI have tried cold butter, soft butter, melted butter. It will not set.\n\nWe always use the same brand of cocoa, vanilla, and evaporated milk that my grandma told us to use.\n\n\nWe would make this pie with her so we know she wasn't pulling any shenanigans like giving us a bad recipe. My grandma died around the time the pie completely stopped working, so my mom and I can't ask her what's going on.\n\n\nWe really want our fudge pie back on the table for Thanksgiving. Can anyone figure out why this recipe no longer works when it was such a good recipe before? We don't want another chocolate lava pie. Though at least this failure is delicious, we just want our fudge pie back.\n\nEdit: https://old.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/1gqwh7k/fudge_pie_my_grandma_would_always_make_for/\n\nProof there is no flour/starch and grandma wasn't hiding the flour lol\n\n\n\nFINAL EDIT:\n\nI have made 6 pies in the past 24 hours. All but two were soup. The last two... the very last two were a success.\n\n\nAs I was staring into the oven on the last pie I realized what is going on. I saw the bastard that has ruined so many pies.\n\n\nIn my grandma's oven, the rack was in the middle. There were only 3 slots to place the rack in her oven. I have 5. The antique oven in the house I used to live in had 3. The 1970s oven that baked the pie correctly had 3. As I stared with sheer contempt as the massive size of the modern oven compared to the hot box dinosaurs that used to bake this pie perfectly, I realized the smaller ovens, the middle rack setting was closer to the heating element, with an element that wasn't under a sheet of metal, but on display proudly mere inches away from the rack. I cursed my bastard oven and all the other ovens that failed me. How dare they be so large. My grandma's oven could barely fit a turkey on the bottom rack. My grandma's oven was as old as I was when she taught me to make this stupid pie. All the other ovens I used that this recipe worked were older than I was. The ovens my mom used that baked this recipe correctly were older than me, and failed in newer, larger ovens.\n\n\nIt wasn't setting because of mixing method, ingredients, crust, or pie pan. It wasn't close enough to the fucking heating element.",

They will still give the correct flavor without becoming to hard. \n\nTo make the candy easier to bite into: add 1 tablespoon of baking soda to the pan *(after you have added all the other ingredients)*. Stir VERY well. The candy will foam up. But that's what you want. Baking soda adds air pockets to the candy making it easier to eat."

They were the perfect crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle, almost like a McDonald\u2019s cookie but better. However this time around, I used the same recipe and my cookies came out way different. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the flour content, because the last time I made the recipe, I didn\u2019t use the full amount of flour, as the author wrote that it may differ depending on how things looked, and the dough looked like it didn\u2019t need the rest, however this time I just put all the flour. But the thing is, every cookie recipe I make comes out the same. I\u2019ll comment a picture as I can\u2019t post more than two, but they look like the picture, round, smooth, and a gross, wet, chewy, almost raw on the inside. But I took them out while the centers were still gooey, like the recipe said. And any longer they just become overbaked. So what am I doing wrong? ",

The edges were golden brown once I removed from the oven. \n- The recipe is for a 9 inch pan but I reduced it (by doing maths) for a 8 inch pan.\n- I removed the caramel and poured it onto the freshly baked shortbread once it reached 107C/225F.\nFor the chocolate, I used 200g chocolate chips and 1/4 cup double cream (heavy cream).\n\nThanks in advance!",

I use Nordic Ware Naturals aluminum half sheets (as FYI).  I have an oven thermometer. My oven is accurate and maintains temperature well.\n\nI followed both recipes exactly* and weighed all of my dry ingredients.  I chilled both doughs overnight (14 hours or so), along with my cookie sheets.  I started creaming my butter when it hit 60F for recipe #1 and 58F for recipe #2. My kitchen was very warm (75-80 during the dough making) as I\u2019d toasted sugar all day.\n\n* I did not include nuts in my cookies.  Recipe #1 called them optional, Recipe #2 did not.  I don\u2019t like nuts in chocolate chip cookies.  Also, I used parchment paper. Recipe #1 said silicon baking mats.\n\nMy results are a disappointment on the thickness scale.  I also couldn\u2019t get the internal temperature to the target range (175-185) on recipe #2 without darkening my cookies too much.  \n\nThey both taste great. Recipe #1 is my new favorite chocolate chip recipe.\n\nAny thoughts as to what might be wrong??",

But after a minute the batter oozed out of the skin layer that had formed before. \nWhy did this happen? What can I do to prevent this the next time?\n\nThis was the recipe:\nMacaron Batter\n1 cup (125g) powdered sugar\n1/2 cup (50g) powdered almonds\n3 tbsp (25g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n2 large egg whites (66g) , at room temperature\npinch of salt\n5 tbsp (75g) granulated sugar\n\nInstructions\nPrepare the chocolate macaron shells.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00baF (180\u00baC).\nLine two baking sheets with parchment paper and have a pastry bag with a plain tip (about 1/2-inch, 1cm) ready.\nGrind together the powdered sugar with the almond powder and cocoa so there are no lumps; use a blender or food processor. Then sift the mixture into a large bowl and discard the larger lumps.\nUsing a mixer beat the egg whites until they begin to rise and hold their shape. While whipping, beat in the granulated sugar until very stiff and firm, about 2 minutes.\n\nFold the dry ingredients, in two batches, into the beaten egg whites with a rubber spatula. When the mixture is smooth and there are no streaks of egg white, stop folding and scrape the batter into the pastry bag. The macaronage is ready when the batter falls off the spatula in a thick ribbon and starts to settle into the rest of the batter after about 20 seconds. Be cautious not to overmix, as this can lead to flat macarons. \nPipe the batter on the parchment-lined baking sheets in 1-inch (2.5 cm) circles evenly spaced 1-inch (2.5cm) apart.\nRap the baking sheet a few times firmly on the countertop to flatten the macarons, and remove air bubbles. Allow the macarons to sit for 20 to 30 minutes until a \u201cskin\u201d forms and they are no longer wet when lightly touched.\n\nBake them for 10-15 minutes. Let cool completely then remove from baking sheet",

Continue until the meringue forms stiff, glossy peaks, and the sugar is dissolved.\nAdd favour (Optional):\nMix in the extract just before the stiff peaks stage.

        "selftext": "Hey y'all.\n\nI haven't been active on this board for very long, but so far I've really enjoyed everyone and everything on here. As a professional in the culinary industry for over 15 years, and a professional pastry chef for the last 8, I love being able to share what I've learned over the years with those either just breaking into the hobby, home bakers looking to turn it up a notch, or even other professionals looking for new ideas. This sub has been a real pleasure, so thank you. \n\nThat being said, I just want to point out something I've noticed lately. A lot of users who are having issues with recipes are getting them from sources like Tasty, SoYummy, and BuzzFeed. If it seems like these sites are a great place for some recipes, please understand that these are not always reputable sources. For one, they have been known to steal ideas from other internet contributors, and are really designed to make money by getting you to watch their videos. They are not looking out for your best interests, only their own. \n\nIf you are using a recipe that you found in a time lapsed sped up video or from a group that is known for making these videos, please try another recipe first. You are so much better off finding a better cookie or cake or muffin recipe than you are trying to find advice on how to fix a broken one. \n\nEven as a professional, it is really difficult to know what went wrong with a recipe, ESPECIALLY if I can't taste or touch it. It's taken me 10 years of refinement to get a perfect brownie recipe, and I'm STILL working on the chocolate chip cookie. This doesn't just happen over night, and a lot of trial and error is involved, plus a ton of wasted ingredients (unless you're lucky enough like I am to have an SO who will eat anything) If you don't want to have to go through all this time and effort and flour, you're better off finding a food blog you really like rather than these baking videos. \n\nNow, I'm not trying to shame anyone. If you use these sources and they've worked for you, that's fantastic! Keep baking! But if you've used them and something seems off, please consider that it's not you, it's the recipe. \n\nThat's it from me. Happy trails, and keep baking!\n\nEdit: I just want to make something clear. If you successfully use these sources for baking, that's awesome! But I don't need to know about it. Please don't share your success stories in an attempt to prove me wrong. This isn't a wrong or right thing, and I'm not trying to make any arguments.  \n\nI just want newer bakers to understand that if you use them and they DON'T work, it is more likely the recipe than anything you did.\n\nEDIT 2: WOA! I've never gotten a Reddit award before! Not sure what it means, but COOL! Thanks kind stranger! I'm just trying to do my part in helping bakers everywhere. :) <3\n\nEDIT 3: WOA!! A platinum award. Wow. Thanks kind Reddit stranger! I will used this to pass love and cheer to other baking subs! <3<3\nAlso, lots of people asking me for my brownie recipe. I'm okay with giving it away.. maybe we could ask the mods for a special dispensation to post it? That'd be cool.\n\nEDIT 4: I'm starting to think Tasty is trouble shooting their recipes by posting them here. This is the 3rd post I've seen like this in the last month, for the same recipe...\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/iqthlw/advice_on_how_to_cut_down_the_sweetness_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

My moulds were quite small. Make sure the caramel is as dark as possible without burning so the flavour has as much depth as possible.

I mixed the eggs with a hand mixer then added the salt, sugars, and vanilla. I then slowly folded in the melted butter/chocolate into the egg mix until combined. After that I folded in the flour. I baked it at 375 for 15 minutes.\n\nI did deviate from the recipe in one way though; I made the batter earlier in the day when I had free time then I refrigerated it for about 5 hours before I took it out and let it return to room temperature. I did a little research and people said it was fine to put in the fridge for a little bit so idk if that impacted the final product.\n\nSo basically my question is, is the density of the cake a result of my own error or is this the natural result of a recipe with these specific ingredients?

I followed the Claire Saffitz recipe and took some progress pics. 1: laminated dough 2: formed croissants 3: proofed croissants 4: baked croissants. I\u2019d love some tips for improvement!\n\nRight off the bat I noticed when making the detrempe before adding the butter it was too dry according to Claire\u2019s recipe so I gradually added water until it seemed right and then proceeded. Maybe my flour protein percentage was off? I was using harvest mills and that has pretty wide range.\n\nThe lamination seemed okay until the final fold where I could see butter peaking through at the edges. Could this be bc it was too warm? Or maybe the folding and alignment was off?\n\nI proofed in my oven for two hours with the light  on. I was afraid the steamed oven would melt the butter and I fear I was right! Even in this proofing environment I could see some melted butter leaking. Unsure how to fix this because a colder temperature would hinder proofing?\n\nThey proofed with a fervor and came out quite uneven. Is this over proofing?\n\nClaire said to only egg was the smooth surfaces not the folds but mine proofed so unevenly they were like 80% exposed folds haha. They didn\u2019t take on enough color and I had to egg wash again halfway through baking.\n\nThe crumb cake out quite tight. Is this glad to over proofing? Underproofing? Overworking the dough? I\u2019d love some advice for improvement?",

Your best bet is to just get an ambient thermometer/humidity gauge, they're very affordable for cheap digital ones.\n\nYour tight crumb is due to either melted butter or the butter getting incorporated into the dough during lamination after getting too soft.\n\nYour croissants came out uneven because they're rolled too thick, and they aren't cut wide/long enough to be stable while proofing. A longer cut will give more \"steps\" to the croissant, which provides a more stable base.\n\nDon't worry overmuch about washing the exposed layers."

I followed all the ingredients as listed, including the suggested baking time. The only adjustments I made were halving the ingredients and leaving out the walnuts, as the recipe mentioned this was fine (I substituted with some extra all-purpose flour as instructed).\n\nI'm baking with a conventional oven and I checked the temperature with an oven thermometer to make sure it reached the right temp. However, the middle of my cookies still looks darker and underbaked, which is quite noticeable compared to the fully baked edges. I wouldn't mind it the center was just slightly gooey, but the color difference makes it obvious they're not fully done.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on what might be causing this?\n\nHere are photos of the flatter cookie after cooling for 20 mins on the baking sheet.

And yes, there are specific techniques to make souffles so it makes sense to assume a souffle cake is going to behave more like a souffle than a traditional cake.\n\nIt appears the original cake has been cooked in a sloped pan as indicated by the flat \"bottom\" and sloped edges. It appears it's been turned over onto the flat top and the base is the exposed side. I would guess it's probably baked in a ceramic or maybe glass pan, not metal. \n\nBased on pictures alone, you are most likely not using the \"correctly shaped\" pan for this, because a souffle needs a little help creeping up the sides of its vessel. You're using a pan that doesn't encourage souffle-like rising. I would guess the parchment is also an issue preventing the right type of expansion of a souffle cake. \n\nAnd, just based on pictures alone, it doesn't look like you mixed your cake well for a souffle cake. Yours looks quite dense and slightly sunken compared to the recipe picture."

Bring to the boil, then cook to a dark amber caramel colour. Meanwhile warm the cream in a small pan.\n\nCarefully remove the pan from the heat and stir in the warm (not boiling) cream. Return the pan to the heat and boil to 120\u00b0C/248\u00b0F. Remove from the heat and carefully stir in the butter until emulsified.\n\n",

Its seems every other recipe talks about how easy they make things, and EVERY video I see online uses one. \n\nSo I saved up and finally bought a 6 qt bowl lift kitchen aid from Costco because they were on a huge sale. And I feel like it was a huge waste of money. \n\nIs there really supposed to be a good centimeter of clearance where nothing get mixed? And even more on the bottom it seems? I mean I get that you don\u2019t want your attachments to hit the bowl because that could damage them\u2026 but does it need to be that far away? I feel like all of the convenience of the mixer is overshadowed by the amount of time I am spending scraping down that stupid bowl. \n\nI was trying to cream a cup of butter and a cup of sugar today for cookies. I thought that would be plenty of volume to use the mixer. But every fifteen seconds or so I had to stop the mixer and scrape it down because all of the mixture got pushed up the sides and wasn\u2019t getting mixed anymore. Is that user error? Am I missing something? Do I need to be making triple batches of cookies in order to make this thing worth it? I couldn\u2019t help but think the whole time about how much easier it would have been with my hand mixer. \n\nI\u2019m just feeling very defeated. The draw of the stand mixer was to be able to wash dishes or help my kids while things were mixing - but it seems this machine just isn\u2019t made to do that. Is a kitchenaid just not for me? Or am I missing something?\n\nEdit: I will be trying the dime test tonight, thank you! Though it sounds like Kitcchen Aid just isn\u2019t what it used to be which is pretty infuriating (why include a dough hook if you don\u2019t want us to kneed dough? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)",

I\u2019m following a video/recipe, so I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going wrong. The baker in the video shows two ways of preparing this no-knead dough, and the second way (the one I\u2019m following) is supposed to yield a really aerated loaf! When I make it, the dough itself seems to rise the way it\u2019s supposed to (about 2x its original size) while proofing, but it looks like it\u2019s deflating in the oven instead of rising.\n\nStep 1: Whisk together 1.25 cups water, 1 packet of yeast, and about 2 tsp salt. \n\nStep 2: Add 3 cups of flour and mix until it comes together in a wet, sticky dough.\n\nStep 3: Do series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Totals to 4 series of stretch and folds.\n\nStep 4: Preheat oven to 425 Fahrenheit with Dutch oven inside. Once it\u2019s nice and hot, sprinkle flour in pot and plop dough inside. Sprinkle with more flour.\n\nStep 5: Bake for 30 min at 425 with the lid on. Then remove lid and cook for additional 15-20 minutes till the desired color is reached. \n\nAdjustments I\u2019ve tried: \n\nI used King Arthur AP flour the first time. This time, I used bread flour thinking the higher protein might result in a stronger rise, but no luck. I was also more careful in measuring my flour, spooning it into the measuring cup instead of scooping from the bag.\n\nI used lukewarm water the first time, and room temp water this time. Both times the dough was left on the counter to proof per the recipe\u2019s suggestion, and my house isn\u2019t particularly cold.\n\nI\u2019d love to get your thoughts!",

I get it; a lot of my cookbooks have errors like that as well, it happens.\n\nNowadays, I usually see red flags in the ingredients list before I start baking because of experience, but sometimes my cloudy brain does not pay attention at all. It would be great if y\u2019all have recommendations regarding sites that list recipes that have been tested and verified. Any tips? Thanks <3\n\n**Edit:** Super-helpful comments, thanks, everyone!\n\n**Additional edit:** Although there does not seem to be a specific website (yet, u/brangeloo might make it happen) of the kind I'm describing above, I hereby give you a brief summary of the recommendations in this thread:\n\n* When in doubt, use reviews as a point of reference: More in-depth reviews are usually legit, look for pictures to see actual results.\n* Blogs with long-ass stories about the lives of the bloggers that contain more substance than the recipe itself are most definitely a red flag. Don't blindly click the \"skip to recipe\" button, it's not a blessing in disguise. \n* If you don't want to put in too much effort in finding out whether or not a recipe is legit, stick to the mainstream names(e.g. Mary Berry/Martha Stewart/Anna Olson/Ina Garten, etc won't put their name on something that hasn't been tested) or go the traditional route by finding a well-renowned cookbook.\n* This thread seems to crown Sally's Baking Addiction as most reliable!

It\u2019s a simple enough recipe, but hard to nail. After years of practice, I was making excellent batches every time.\n\nThe candy is a layer of toffee and a layer of chocolate. You freeze it and then break it into pieces like bark. About ten years ago though, something strange started to happen\u2014breaking the candy into pieces caused the chocolate layer to separate from the toffee layer. At first it happened once or twice, and then all the time. My mom and I can\u2019t figure out what we\u2019re doing wrong. We haven\u2019t change how we\u2019ve done it or the ingredients. For a while we thought it might be because we weren\u2019t using fresh ingredients, but it still happens even when everything comes straight from the grocery store. Can anyone explain what is happening and what we can do to stop it? It would mean so much to us!\n\nRecipe below \u2b07\ufe0f \n\n2 sticks margarine (Imperial) (note: can\u2019t be substituted with butter)\n3 T. Water\n1 T. Lite Karo Syrup\n3/4 C. Sugar\n1 C. Chopped Pecans\n1 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips (minis works best)\n\nMelt margarine in an electric frying pan at 350 degrees. Add water, Karo syrup, and sugar. Stir constantly until toffee reaches desired consistency and color (about 10 min). Stir in pecans. Pour into a jelly roll pan. Spread to edges of pan. Top with chocolate chips. Once the chocolate melts, spread with rubber scrapper/spatula in a uniform layer. Freeze for at least two hours. Break into pieces. Enjoy!\n\nEDIT: Wow! So much interest! So, I\u2019ve attempted to make two more batches. The first I used butter - turned out soupy with a different flavor, BUT it stuck to the chocolate fine. I think we can safely assume Imperial is the issue. The second batch I swapped Imperial for Land O Lakes margarine. I ended up with the same consistency as the butter and it didn\u2019t stick. Third attempt: one stick Imperial, one stick butter-flavored Crisco. Stay tuned!",

I followed the recipe on YouTube by Natasha\u2019s Kitchen: https://youtu.be/YEZPxhMneOc?si=jbD-rxsAyYvOKR3-\n\nWhy are they so puffed up and cracked? I\u2019m trying to figure out what I did wrong so I can try again next time. \n\nI made three batches. \nFirst batch: Looked too light in color and tasted a bit floury. I baked them at 350 degrees in the oven for about 15~ minutes. Slightly larger than ice cream scooper sized balls. \n\nSecond batch: Made the dough balls smaller and baked them at 350 degrees for about 22~ minutes. Looked a lot darker in color, but still too cracked. Tasted less floury, but not the chewy consistency I hoped.\n\nThird batch: I baked them at 340 degrees in the oven for about 15~ minutes. Slightly larger than ice cream scooper sized balls. Used two parchment paper sheets. Tasted too rough. \n\nDid I possibly overmix? What causes cookies to look cracked and dry? I want to be able to bake soft cookies like in the recipe \ud83c\udf6a ",

        "selftext": "Howdy! \n\nI saw the super cute lobster cake on Pinterest and TikTok and thought I wanted to try it. My friend is from New England originally and thought it would be super cute to make for her birthday. She is also from an Italian family and brings in food all the time, so I thought (in my flavor focused mind) I wanted to make a vanilla cake with a strawberry simple syrup, with a whipped cream frosting and use ricotta to stabilize it. \n\nI whipped the tar out of the ricotta, added 2 cups of whipping cream, let that go, added some sugar. It wasn\u2019t developing peaks. So I put the bowl in the fridge. Let everything get cold. I bloomed a little gelatin just in case (1.5 teaspoons of gelatin+ 1.5 tablespoons of water, let that set, then when I was ready to use I microwaved it to get thin). Started whipping, nothing. Added the gelatin. I\u2019ve made stabilized whipped cream, I know that trick. Nothing. No peaks\u2026 not even soft. Added some powdered sugar to maybe\u2026? Put everything back in the fridge again. Let everything get super cold tried to whip it again. Doubled the amount of gelatin (so a whole packet of it), added water, let it gel, then microwaved. Put the mixing bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes. Slowly added the liquid gelatin. Nothing. I\u2019m whipping for 10 minutes at a time. \n\nI finally put that mix in another bowl and just made some buttercream icing. Adding some ricotta, for flavor (in my brain ricotta and strawberries got well together). My buttercream was soft and I was over it so\u2026 The picture is the final cake. \n\nMy question is can this ricotta/whipping cream/gelatin thing be saved? Or repurposed? I\u2019d hate to throw it away. Thank you in advance. Like I know how to bake. I\u2019ve never had this issue before and it\u2019s weird. ",

In my experience, I could stand corrected, but I have lost a good amount of time and money (in whipped cream) learning this the hard way. \n\nAlso, especially when it's hot and humid outside, I always put my bowl and whisk into the fridge before starting. Cream in the bowl, get it all really good first. Whipped cream is such a fickle fanny, but so darn good.lol."

The crust is made with pate sablee, a layer of raspberry jam, almond cream/frangipane, and lastly pastry cream. \n\nMy first question is: is the crust a good thickness? \nI tried making it 1/8 inch thick but I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s too thick or too thin.\n\nSecond: How thin should the layer of raspberry jam be? I made it super thin since those were the instructions I was given the first time and made it a little thicker the next. The only issue was that it bubbled out of the frangipane layer which I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s ideal or not.\n\nThird: is my crust baked enough?\nThe outer top edges are nice and brown but the sides are a little whiter and same with the bottom. The bottom isn\u2019t crispy either, it\u2019s soft but not soggy either. It holds its shape\n\nLast: any creative/cool ways to decorate the top of a 6\u201d tart with fruit?

The bottom of the first attempt looks slightly darker in the center than the second attempt.  I'm not entirely sure what would cause that.  Perhaps the jam?  You also have a cleaner cut of the first attempt.  Both look quite tasty.  Good luck with perfecting the dish."
