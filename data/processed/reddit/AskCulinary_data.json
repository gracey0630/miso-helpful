I dont know if I'm explaining this properly but anyway it's his birthday tomorrow and I really wanna make him a bowl of 'spaghetti chunk' and meatballs for his birthday meal (as we can't go out to celebrate due to lockdown)\n\nSo yeah I know this is an odd question but how can I cook/prepare the pasta so I can give him a full bowl of chunks? I only have 2 300g packs so not enough for a load of trial and error. I was gonna snap it and cook it in as little water as possible but I really dont know if that will work. Sorry for bizarre question but my son would literally be beside himself with happiness if I were to cook him a big bowl of his goddamn chunks...\nThanks in advance if anyone has any ideas lol",

        "selftext": "I got a lot of responses on [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/jyw0ea/i_want_to_order_japanese_a5_wagyu_steaks_for_my/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)  so I figured I\u2019d take the time to update everyone on how my A5 Wagyu experience went. \n\nFirst of all, thank you so much to every who responded. I learned a lot from that post and changed my wagyu night game-plan quite a bit based on those responses. If I do wagyu again I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing. \n\nI went with a [16 New York Strip](https://i.imgur.com/8QVhjS1.jpg) from Crowd Cow. I planned on doing about 6 ounces for my wife and I but upped it to 8 ounces each, which ended up being a tad too much, but we ate it all anyway (mostly me) and I have no regrets. Next time I\u2019ll do a little less but honestly it\u2019ll be more to save money. I would happily eat another 8-10oz. \n\nThe first method, based on advice received here, I cut off about half the steak and [seared on medium-high heat](https://i.imgur.com/r623lKn.jpg) for a little over 1 minute per side. It came out [rare to medium rare](https://i.imgur.com/R6O3Z5e.jpg) and I _think_ it was my personal favorite style but it\u2019s difficult to say. It\u2019s hard to judge something so amazing. We ate this by itself or with a bit of wasabi and soy sauce. Also went great with the sushi rice. \n\nNext I [sliced some thin](https://i.imgur.com/Zbluq98.jpg) and [served over sushi rice ](https://i.imgur.com/1VoiRMi.jpg)with some real Japanese wasabi, thin slice of raw garlic, and a small pinch of finishing salt. This went amazing with a touch of artisan soy sauce. Thank you to u/zonidel for this recommendation, we enjoyed it immensely and I highly recommend anyone considering doing Wagyu to try this method, as unconventional as it may seem. \n\nThe last method, which was my wife\u2019s favorite, I took 1-inch strips of the uncooked steak and seared them on a super hot pan until nicely charred. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t take a pic as I cooked these halfway through the meal and was too busy having the best experience of my life. The strips came out perfectly crispy, and although they were cooked medium to medium well throughout, were incredibly tender and melted after a couple bites. It\u2019s true what some of you told me, A5 wagyu does not need to be medium-rare. I\u2019m glad I listened to you all on that regard. \n\n[Here\u2019s a poorly lit photo of the initial spread](https://i.imgur.com/sfWF1Qy.jpg), sans the well-charred strips that were cooked later. The steaks went perfectly with some sushi rice and a Sichuan-style smashed cucumber salad. The vinegar in each provided a perfect balance to the rich steak. Shout out to u/emil10001 for the cucumber salad recommendation. \n\n[Bonus video of the steak being cut](https://i.imgur.com/HCt6IYW.mp4).\n\nThanks again to everyone who helped. I learned a lot from people I didn\u2019t mention above, u/cycocyco, u/cc69, u/alternative_reality to name a few. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about my experience please feel free to ask!\n\nI suppose since this is r/askculinary I should take advantage and ask a question. What do you all recommend I make with my leftover wagyu fat? I have a good 2.5 ounces to work with.",

        "selftext": "I wanted to thank everyone who helped answer [my question from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/qt3nxl/whats_the_best_way_to_disassemble_raspberries/)\n\nWe went with liquid nitrogen, which worked great! We didn't wind up trying Pectinex, which was the other really interesting suggestion. Unfortunately, we couldn't find some in time to experiment with it.\n\nLiquid nitrogen fast froze the raspberries in a matter of seconds. They were then easy to roll apart in our fingers and pop in the freezer for storage. We were able to set up a production line and crank through 10 pounds really fast with just four people. Our previous attempts to simply freeze the berries in the freezer resulted in too much mushiness upon thawing, but the rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen resulted in much firmer bits.\n\nAbout an hour before rehearsal, we pulled them out and spread them on sheets to defrost. The effect was exactly what the bride was hoping for.\n\nSome other suggestions that didn't work for us or we couldn't easily try:\n\n* Freeze dried raspberry bits - As I mentioned in a comment on the previous post, these were too light to throw well. Someone suggested rehydrating them. I had a pretty good guess as to what would happen, but tried it anyways. The freeze dried bits just turned to mush in water. No good. The bride really wanted fresh anyways.\n* Gelification/spherification - We actually had the stuff for this from a cocktail party we had hosted. It took a little while to get the timing down so the resulting blobs weren't too hard or soft, but the bride didn't like the way they looked. She thought they seemed unnatural and would be too much like throwing little rubber beads. She really wanted fresh berries.\n* Blasting the berries with compressed air - We didn't have fast access to a high powered compressor, but we were skeptical that this would actually work. It seemed like it was more likely to make a mess. We got liquid nitrogen working before we were motivated enough to find a compressor and try this.\n* Breaking them up in an ultrasonic water bath - This sounded interesting, but we couldn't get one quickly.\n* Pushing the berries through a screen or mesh - Before finding/building a full mesh, we prototyped with some wire. Basically, anything that involved using pressure mashed the berries too much before breaking them apart.\n* Training animals to pick them apart - WTF? We had like a day to come up with a process before the rehearsal and we aren't animal trainers.\n* Hiring blind or disabled people from a local work program - That seemed more like a suggestion for recruiting help and didn't really assist with the process of disassembling.\n* Picking them apart with blunt needles - We had already tried tweezers and were effectively already using them like blunt needles anyways. It was very slow.\n* Using fake berries - No good. Bride wanted fresh berries.\n* Using a hole punch to cut confetti from leaves - The pictures of this that people shared looked pretty, but not what the bride wanted.\n* Using pomegranates - Nope. Bride wanted raspberries.",

Turns out we kinda got mislead by the organizer which brought down our total tickets, and people really preferred our signature items over the burgers and dogs (which is encouraging).  We could try to add them to our menu at other events but to do so we had to remove our favorite signature item, so we don't want to upset our regulars or change what we are about and become a burger and dog truck in an already saturated market.  \n\nPlease help, if we just take the loss on these it is going to be terrible for us.\n\nUpdate 1: thanks everyone for all the support!  I am truly touched by all the support and ideas.  All the kind words really make me not feel as terrible about the mistake I made.  \n\nThe distributer helped us out by getting us some free samples of pork shoulder and brisket to help us recoup some of our losses.  We added a special called the hog dog, its the hot dog split down the middle and fried on the griddle, then we fill the split with bbq, top with bbq sauce and coleslaw,  it fit our theme and our regulars really loved it.  It sold really well, but unfortunately due to rain our baseball tournament got canceled so we had to do smaller events.  However it did help us offload about 20 lbs of dogs.  The burgers were also selling pretty steadily so we don't have anything drastic to do there yet.  We have another tournament this weekend so I will update again after that.  Thanks everyone!!\n\nUpdate 2:  we had another good weekend.  We used the brisket the distributor gave us and put it on top of a burger.  We sold all but 1 serving in a day, which was great because I was eyeing that burger all day!  We also did the hog dog again and sold out.  We did another baseball tournament and worked through a few more cases of regular burgers and dogs so we are moving them pretty decently.  This week we have another brewery and more baseball so I think we are going to try chili dogs, and maybe try to play with corn dogs.  Also depending on the cost of the brisket we may put that back on the menu, people really loved it and we got some amazing compliments that made us feel really good.",

        "title": "Making Ivan Ramen's \"Vegetable fat\"?",
        "selftext": "As a recent vegetarian convert I've been trying out various vegetarian meals in NYC. The best one I've stumbled upon so far is Ivan ramen's vegetarian ramen, which, to simulate the unctuousness of pork/chicken stock, uses what he calls \"vegetable fat\". Ever since that meal i've been thinking about how great it would be to have that at my disposal to give that fatty deliciousness to otherwise meat-free recipes. \n\nI asked the chef what this wonderful substance was, and he said they infuse canola oil with vegetables and seaweed over a period of 5 hours. The description of Serious eats calls it \"'vegetable fat'\u2014oil flavored with their house soffrito and seaweed\" which seems to confirm that. Now I just have to figure out how to make it.\n\nAnother Ivan ramen recipe for \"Chile-Eggplant Mazemen Ramen with Pork Belly\" has a step to make a chile eggplant sofrito:\n\n\"CHILE-EGGPLANT SOFRITO\n\n1 cup canola oil\n\n1 large onion, minced (2 cups)\n\n1/2 small eggplant, minced (1 1/2 cups)\n\n2 medium tomatoes, minced (1 1/4 cups)\n\n2 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder\n\nKosher salt\"\n\n\"In a large saucepan, heat the oil. Add the onion and eggplant and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very soft, about 1 hour. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have almost melted, about 1 hour. Stir in the chipotle powder and cook for 15 minutes longer; season with salt. Transfer the sofrito to a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Drain the sofrito in a sieve; discard the oil or reserve it for another use.\"\n\n/u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt's vegan ramen recipe has another similar mushroom-scallion oil\n\n\"For the Mushroom-Scallion Oil:\n\n1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms\n\n1/2 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms\n\n6 scallions, very roughly chopped\n\n1/2 cup vegetable or canola oil\"\n\n\"Combine dried porcini, dried shiitake, scallions, and oil in a small saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook, stirring, until scallions and mushrooms are releasing a thin, steady stream of bubbles. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to infuse [for about 30 minutes]\"\n\nSo, given these, it seems like for fresher vegetables, it's 1-2 hours, and for dried items, it's 15-30 minutes. I figure that the soffrito is the same for both (onion, eggplant and tomatoes) but instead of chipotle chili powder you use kombu. So I guess my last question is: how much kombu to use? Given that it's 1 oz of dried mushrooms for a 1/2 cup of the oil. It seems like the equivalent of kombu is 1 or 2 6 inch pieces of kombu. \n\nI guess that's all the results of my research. Has anybody done something similar and can weigh in?",

Reserve garlic for another use. Allow oil to cool and add remaining ingredients to oil. Use an immersion blender to disperse dry ingredients. Allow to sit 24 hours before use.

It isn't mild by any means (though nor is it strident like rosemary or oregano) - but it is easy to overlook in a complex dish because it has a sort of alto/tenor \"inner voice\" quality which doesn't draw attention to itself.\n\nYou can use the milk mixture to make any white sauce, especially with fish (eg a British fish pie). It also makes outstanding egg custard, better than vanilla IMO in a sort of medieval-hipster way. Another excellent recipe is Marcella Hazan's [pork stewed with porcini and juniper](https://rhubarbfool.co.uk/tag/marcella-hazan/) (I wouldn't bother to crumble them). There is a lot going on there but the bay is an important part to my taste.\n\nI find the taste of fresh bay leaves unpleasant and always used dried. They store reasonably well as best I can tell.\n\nEdit: opinion on fresh versus dried withdrawn for further testing."

        "selftext": "I'm the resident pastry wizard at [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/editors/stella-parks)\u2014technically, my title is senior editor, but when [Ed Levine](https://www.amazon.com/Serious-Eater-Lovers-Perilous-Redemption/dp/0525533540/?tag=serieats-20) gives you a nickname, you stick with it. I got my first restaurant job at 14, went to the Culinary Institute of America at 18, and have been baking professionally (or writing about it) ever since.\n\nI spent six-odd years writing a cookbook called [*BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts*](https://www.amazon.com/BraveTart-American-Desserts-Stella-Parks/dp/0393239861/?tag=serieats-20), a New York Times bestseller that went on to nab a James Beard Award. You may be more familiar with my pal [Kenji](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087/?tag=serieats-20), who wrote the foreword. My book covers the history behind everything from Snickers to Snickerdoodles, with recipes for all that and more.\n\nI approach baking as a craft, so my recipes are all about spending time in the kitchen because it's fun. For me, making a [homemade Klondike bar](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/09/homemade-diy-klondike-bars.html) is as satisfying as eating it, so it's rare that my recipes quick or easy; I don't see baking as a chore to be done with ASAP, but a pleasurable way to explore new ingredients and technique.\n\nNo shame if that's not your jam\u2014some people would prefer to get out of the kitchen and on with life, and others would prefer not to get into the kitchen at all. Quick and easy recipes, as well as store bought treats, are there for folks who need them. You'll get no shade from me.\n\nI'll pop by as much as I can today to answer questions about whatever comes up. I love talking about American desserts and baking traditions, technique both classic and modern, as well as equipment and culinary history, and copycat recipes. I'm easily derailed by anything relating to the Dragon Age fandom, Star Trek (particularly DS9), WebToons, and Bjork. AMA!\n\n**Update: Okay, it's 9pm and time to go play some vidja games. Big thanks to [u/albino-rhino](https://www.reddit.com/user/albino-rhino) for having me, and to everyone who stopped by. If you still have a burning question, just remember it's AMA every day on [twitter](https://twitter.com/BraveTart) and [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/).**",

Highly recommend!\n\nAs recommended by Samin Nosrat in her podcast, I made sure to find and purchase Diamond Kosher salt before proceeding with the recipe. After spatchcocking (we chopped the spine up into 3-4 pieces for making a chicken jus), I placed the chicken into a turkey bag and covered it with the buttermilk brine. It sat in the bag, in a baking pan in the fridge for about 36 hours.\n\nI pulled the chicken out of the marinade 1.5 hours before it was time to cook. I gave it a pat down with some paper towels and covered it loosely while it warmed up. At this time I also brought out my herb butter to soften at RT.\n\nAbout 20 min before cooking, I loosened the skin from the meat and liberally rubbed that herb butter under the skin.\n\nI pulled it out after measuring a few degrees above 165F in the thigh, but it was still so moist and tender. It was about 50-55 minutes total cooking time.\n\nI honestly forgot to rotate it once it started cooking, which I regretted after. The browning was a little off, I want sure if it was because I forgot to rotate it or because I didn\u2019t baste it. Either way it tasted amazing! Can\u2019t wait to do it again!\n\nSide note: the pan dripping were constantly burning! If someone has a tip for this I would appreciate it! My bird was cooked on a cooling rack situated on top of a baking sheet lined with foil.",

I pride myself on being able to \"connect the dots\" and combine many different ways of preparing foods into something I find delicious. \n\nSpecifically, I combined my love for British Indian Restaurant cuisine with my decisively Western taste and tradition to make dishes that one can call fundamentally \"Western\", but which jump out and present super strong and enticing flavors to the consumer. \n\nLast night I went to make BIR style curry for the family and somehow I ended up using too much ginger and garlic paste. The final product was overwhelmingly sour, which I attributed to ginger. I was really disappointed and was considering diluting the curry with more tomatoes and fresh peppers to bring the acidity down, but that had its own set of challenges. \n\nThen I remembered a tip that I saw on this sub of using baking soda to lower acidity of dishes and decided to give it a shot, even though it intuitively seemed to me like a way to ruin a dish and make it taste \"artificial\".\n\nWell, it worked really well. One teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of brown sugar brought the curry to a really good place. I'm enjoying it now and I don't detect anything \"artificial\" about it. \n\nIf it wasn't for this sub, I would have likely discarded the whole pot and started from scratch again.\n\nThank you all who contribute your very valuable experience here.",

This means professional chefs and most cookbook writers use kosher salt for everything and thus they will typically specify \"kosher salt\" in the ingredients, otherwise the same amount of table salt will make the food very salty. Kosher salt is also not iodized, and some people dislike the taste of iodized salt, especially chefs, who often care a lot about how food tastes.\n\nAs for what's up outside of America, I can't really say."

                "author": "Lionhearted09",
                "body": "I have been in restaurant food supplies for 18 years and worked for 6 different suppliers. I don't think I even know where to begin with debunking all the misinformation in this thread already. \n\nThis is a much more huge and complex question than most people realize. Even the high end dining establishments with two very similar menus can have two completely different sourcing strategies. There are some kitchens that do so many things completely from scratch but I think people would be surprised to find out how many items come premade in high end kitchens as well. Take for example something as completely simple as French Fries. I can walk into a kitchen that serves $40-$50 entrees and find a box of frozen Lamb Weston french fries that are hand cut with skin on and been properly washed, blanched and frozen. I can also walk into a low end kitchen and find a Lamb Weston box of french fries but those are scraps from cuts that have just been frozen. Same manufacturer, same plant, same machine, it just a different french fry that gets boxed. Fewer than 5% of restaurants cut their own french fries and given the quality of the more expensive frozen fries, there isn't always a reason to. You would be surprised at how far food science has come and what items are coming from premade and frozen. There are different tiers of frozen though. You will find a freezer in every higher end restaurant. Fewer than 1% of restaurants use no frozen items. \n\nI see a lot of misinformation on produce supply as well. The small independent produce supplier has the same box of Mann's lettuce as the big boys. Farms want to most stable supplier to offer them contracts on their supply. So often times the first pick of the fields go to the big guys. In fact US Foods and SYSCO both have employees that go to farms and pick what fields they want their supply to come from. Plus they have their own distribution so often the produce makes it onto a truck within 48 hours of being harvested. The small guys have to wait for the rest of the fields to be shipped to terminal markets and buy from whole sale suppliers there often meaning they hold product longer. Also smaller suppliers do not have food safety measures in place. The reason to go with a produce specific company for higher end restaurants is that they offer more specialty items, can make up for poor quality by doing 2nd runs same day and offer more delivery days. All of this could relate to meat as well. \n\nFrozen gets a bad rap but often times chefs prefer some things frozen. Take green peas for example. They can be frozen at peak of freshness whereas most fresh that comes in is hard to keep from getting too soft, so most chefs buy frozen even in scratch kitchens. Bread can very well be another example. Bread can be frozen at peak freshness and thawed and resume at near the same state. A lot of bakery suppliers offer shelf stable bread that is several days old. I have worked for a bakery that does fresh daily bread but how many restaurants get daily deliveries? We may have baked fresh every day but if we deliver a load and it's 3 days until the next delivery you are eating 3-4 day old bread at your higher end restaurant. \n\nJust throwing out another random example is Hollandaise sauce. Medium to higher end restaurants that do brunch don't always find a benefit of doing their own hollandaise. You'd be surprised at how many buy it in jugs. However, that really expensive shelf stable hollandaise is not the same hollandaise the small diner is buying. Yes you can tell the small diner doesn't make their own hollandaise because it's chalky and not rich. The higher end if very hard to tell.\n\nA common cutting tactic among food distributers is have chefs blind taste test high end pre made products vs their own and it's always surprising how many they cannot find a quality difference. The main point is there are different tiers of premade and quality food. People have a perception of how medium to high end restaurants source and I think you'd be very surprised to go look at the back of house boxes.\n\nLast note is when I'm talking about higher end restaurants I am talking of restaurants with $30-$50 entrees and not Michelin star places. Those are a different beast. Like I said in the beginning there are differences among EVERY restaurant. I can walk you into a place with less than $10 entrees that is all made from scratch and I can walk you into a $30 entr\u00e9e place that is majority premade higher end products.\n\nOk really last note now. COVID caused a lot of restaurants to throw out large amounts of inventory and lay off staff so many have no one to prep products now so even more than before is sourcing higher end quality premade and frozen products.\n\nEDIT: thinking about it, we often discuss with chefs what truly counts as \"from scratch\". Less than 100 years ago every chef and even home cook knew how to make cheese. How many restaurants make their own cheese now. I don't know of a single one. If you had a chef from 100 years ago walk into a kitchen today and see chefs using a prepacked cheese, even if it's higher end, they would scoff that they aren't really making their own. However, if a chef adds it to a dish today and the rest is made themselves, they are considered to still have done it from scratch. \n\nTake milled flour as well. There used to be so many local mills because flour used to go bad quickly! So you had to have it milled close to homes. Flour today has additives in it to make it shelf stable. Virtually every kitchen in the world uses this shelf stable flour with additives and no one bats an eye. Pastry and cakes and anything else made with it is still from scratch but yet if we got a piece of meat or sauce with additives in there we would scoff. \n\nThe point is the industry has continually moved towards products that a short time ago would be considered not fresh or from scratch. The industry is continually moving there and some restaurants are more ahead of the curve than others. I think some of the things we scoff at restaurants for not doing themselves right now will be common place before the end of most of our lives."

                "body": "Here's things in random order as I think of them.   \n\nFirst off, you're gonna burn things. A lot of things. It's a learning experience.  Don't let anyone tell you to turn down the heat.  I mean... turn down the heat for some things, but other things where you need the firepower, learn to use the heat rather than tame it.  \n\nThe absolute most important thing to know (outside of the fire extinguisher) is mise en place.  You have literal seconds before things start burning so you don't have time to stop and get something when the train starts rolling.    \n\nEquipment wise, you'll need a ladle (which you already have), a wok spatula, a metal strainer that fits over a pot with the pot, and a bamboo brush. First two are obvious. You'll use one or both tools to manipulate the food.  The metal strainer (google wok strainer, it'll look kinda like a wok but with holes) is to filter food cooked in oil.  The pot holds the oil.  Something without handles is best. Measure your work area to find one that fits the front part.  This is where you effectively oil blanch foods. Use this oil to cook with as well.  \n\nThe bamboo brush is how you clean the wok.  After you're done cooking a dish, use the ladle and ladle some water out of the water \"can\".  \"Wash\" (more like rinse) and use the brush to get any food particles.  The wok burner itself should have a drain and a basket to collect food particles.   If it doesn't, dump it in the sink with a strainer.  \nSome of the fancier wok setups have a 2nd burner for a pot of water. This is meant to be used for blanching and as a source of water.  Since you don't have this, keep a metal \"pot\" of water around. You don't want to fiddle with the tap during cooking.  \nMeasure the back part to fit it there.   \n\nUse your knee to adjust the flames.  Things getting out of control or you have to add a few things? Turn it down a little.  Yeah I broke my own rule. It was more meant for \"cook on low\".   \n\nEveryone and their dog says use day old rice for fried rice. This is only true if you don't have a wok burner.  You're one of the few lucky ones that can use fresh rice.  Cook some off 1:1 water:rice.  It's a low ratio.  Spread it out on a plate to cool when cooked.  \nHere's where you prep things like eggs/chicken/bbq pork/shrimp/etc.  \n\nWhen you're ready to cook, oil the rice and set aside.  Oil the wok, add the eggs, and scramble.  Set those aside. Highest heat you can get and oil the wok again (fairly heavily) and dump in the rice.  Break it up as much as you can with the spatula. Basically \"chop\" it.  Toss the rice and continue breaking it up using the back of the ladle in a beating motion. Continue this toss and and beat until your rice toasts. Add in your cooked chicken/pork/shrimp/whatever. Add your eggs, a handful of peas, and bean sprouts. Toss again to incorporate.  Add salt.  Taste.  Adjust with more salt.  Toss once more and plate.  The perfect actually fried rice.  \n\nFor something like mixed veg, you want to blanch the veg.  Heat the wok, add in some garlic, then the blanched veg.  Add a seasoning sauce (we had a \"generic\" one with white pepper, chicken powder, salt, and a few other things) but you can use anything you want.   Add in some water and mix in a corn starch slurry.  Heat til thick and plate.  Most of the cooking is done via blanch.   \n\nChow mein (and veggies), blanch the noodles and drain.  Heat up, oil in, noodles in, water in, soy sauce in.  The water helps distribute the soy evenly.  Cook off the water and you're effectively done.  We used our \"generic\" seasoning but again, use anything you want.  \n\nAny other dishes you're curious about or if you need more than basically a bullet point that I gave above, feel free to ask."

My intuition is that most dried spices get milder, since a lot of flavor compounds would evaporate at high temperatures, and it's also been my anecdotal experience when cooking Indian cuisine, where proper toasting (\"tempering\") can turn an unbearable amount of spices into something quite mild and tasty.

What she read online was that you should cook the prime rib on the highest setting your oven can go for only a few mins and then shut your oven off and leave the roast in there for 2+ hours until done. \n\nSeems wacky to me. Is there any truth to this or should I try to convince her to cook it the usual way. For the record, we usually have prime rib for Christmas so she has cooked it before and it usually comes out decent\n\nUpdate: I was wrong. My mom did cook it the high heat and then off for 2 hours method. It just came out of the oven and is the perfect temp. On the rare side but we prefer it rare. People who wanted it less rare put theirs under the broiler for a min. It was delicious! We will probably cook it this way next Christmas! Thanks for everyone's input! Merry Christmas!",

It does not constitute a judgement on the quality of our product or the qualifications of our team. There are some modifications/requests that _do_ frequently offend the sensibilities of the cook staff, but a well-done temp isn't among them.\n\nAn order for a well-done is still upsetting though, for several reasons. A well-done generally takes longer to cook than _anything else_ on the menu, which can drag an order and disrupt the flow of service. Also, good cooks generally like to make good food, and they generally think of a well-done as being bad food. It's dispiriting to take good product (steaks are often the most expensive line item on the food budget, per portion) and be ordered \"ruin\" it. To many cooks it seems irrational or ignorant to order the most expensive thing on the menu, only to have it rendered tough and tasteless. Cooks have an ongoing low-level simmer of contempt for all customers, but being forced to enable their poor judgement in such a way can cause that disdain to boil over.\n\nSo while ordering a steak well-done _does upset_ the cooks, it's not exactly _rude_. The cooks are a haughty and judgemental lot, and in their view someone who orders a well-done is perceived as lacking in refinement, knowledge, and/or personal strength of character."

A good example of this would be the differences in American (US) style butchery and Spanish butchery. The primal cuts are pretty much the same with some debate as to where the major cuts should be made however the sub primal get broken down very differently. Two major factors that affect the subprimal cuts are intended use and cutting equipment. In more industrialized societies you see more of what would be called square cutting, where a butcher breaks the primal down into more uniform cuts based on where it is easiest to cut through the bones with a band saw. In countries with a longer tradition of butchery/charcuterie you see more of what would be called seam butchery where primals are broken down into muscle groups and individual muscles with as little use of a band saw as possible. There are also regional differences in the names given to certain cuts which can lead to confusion as well."

And predictably, it tasted nothing like the one at Septime.\n\nSurely the chefs at these restaurants are not preparing vegetables in the same ways that people cook them at home, but... what are they doing different then?  There's only so many things you can do with vegetables: char, sous vide, roast, saut\u00e9, etc.  I'm also getting most of my vegetables from the local farmers markets in SF, so I wouldn't think vegetable quality itself is the issue.  Anyone know what these places are doing differently?",

        "selftext": "MY NEW VERSION OF THIS PROCESS IS LOCATED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/avme9u/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning_updated/\n\nI am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips. It has been my favorite go to snack every sense I was a kid. But yet I always wondered how the seasoning was made so when I dug down and did a little research I found out how industry produces the seasoning and modified the process to replicate at home. This seasoning produced in this recipe is very vinegary and worth the time involved making it!\n\nBefore we get started I just want to make clear that this process is still experimental and I am still playing around with it. Once I figure out a better way of producing it I will post it. \n\nSo to start we all know the main chemical used as the flavoring agent in Salt and Vinegar seasoning is Sodium Diacetate and industrially it is made by combing Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) with Glacial Acetic Acid (99% Pure Vinegar) to form Sodium Acetate. Then more Glacial Acidic acid is added to lock in the acidic flavor and convert the chemical over to Sodium Diacetate.\n\nBut for my process we will be using Vinegar instead of Glacial Acetic Acid, Baking Soda instead of Lye, and Citric Acid in replacement of the acetic acid. The addition of the citric acid will be explained later in the recipe.\n\nThis home version (in theory) produces Sodium Diacetate along with a small amount of Sodium Citrate without using dangerous industrial chemicals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW MAKE SALT AND VINEGAR SEASONING**\n\n1. Add **2.4L** of White Distilled Vinegar to a large pot.\n2. Add **100g** of Baking Soda to the vinegar **IN SMALL AMOUNTS!** After the solution has finished bubbling, heat the solution to 160F for 1 hour to ensure the reaction has completed.\n3. Evaporate the solution by boiling it down to about **1/10** of its original volume (or more) until you see crystals start to form at the top of the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *During the evaporation process you will begin to see crystals forming on the side of the pot as well. Collect a small portion of these from the pot and set them aside to use as seed crystals for the crystallization process.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*4.* After boiling down the liquid transfer it to a clean beaker and cool the liquid in an ice bath. When the solution has cooled down to room temperature take a seed crystal and drop it into the solution. (You should immediately see the liquid start to crystallize).\n\n5. Transfer the newly formed Sodium Acetate crystals to some coffee filters and Allow it to dry. After drying the Sodium Acetate grind it into a fine powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(PART 2)*** **Making Salt and Vinegar Seasoning:**\n\n1. Add **140g** of Sodium Acetate to a beaker.\n2. Add **21g** of Sea Salt to the mixture along with **12g** of Corn Starch and combine well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The Corn Starch is added to prevent the seasoning from clumping after drying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Next add **24-27g** of Citric Acid ***(This step converts (some) of the sodium acetate back to acetic acid)***. Stir the powders until the powder starts to clump up and becomes a wet slimy paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The powder will clump together and become wet due to acetic acid forming thus combining with the left over unconverted sodium acetate. The powder is now comprised of both Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid and possibly a little harmless sodium citrate. Which in theory is our desired sodium diacetate product. I have come up with this hypothesis because sodium diacetate is a combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid which is just what we have created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.

They don't  taste at all of cream cheese. I was partially expecting some of the  Tang, but it's not there. They taste like a cross between a cookie and a  biscuit.\n\nAs wet as the dough was, I was worried about whether they'd melt  or some such, but they didn't. If anything they held their shape too  well. They are edible, and I would even dare say tasty, but I wouldn't  do this again if I had no reason to conserve butter and use up cream  cheese.\n\nI'd like to add that they seem a bit bland.

While we were talking about it she mentioned not being able to mix a small layer of flour in the bottom into the dough without stopping to scrape the bottom up. I told here I had the same problem, which led to me finding out about the dime test.\n\nI tested her mixer and sure enough, no dime movement. Easy fix right? Just turn the adjustment screw and you're on your way? Well after turning the screw as far to the left that the machine will allow it still wasn't touching the dime. I figured maybe she got a unit that was defective, so I went home and tested on my kitchenaid. It's a similar model with the bowl lifting lever mechanism. Same exact results. After adjusting the screw the paddle still won't touch the dime.\n\nSo, my question is do we have two kitchenaid mixers that won't adjust properly? Maybe I'm missing something? Any help would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: After reading through all the comments I thought I would give y'all an update. While my mixer does not pass the dime test, I did confirm I have always been using it with the bowl adjusted to the largest gap between the bowl and attachments (d'oh!). \n\nI just made a double batch of basic white sandwich bread, and it mixed quite a bit better without having to fuss with the bottom of the bowl so much. So, problem fixed I guess? I was probably just getting too hung up on it passing the dime test, you know, because Kitchenaid says they should.",

To my surprise, it has worked extremely well against even the toughest, almost-burnt-on fonds.

Tips?\n\nUPDATE: I couldn\u2019t hold back.. I made Mac and cheese. It turned out amazing and the best I have ever had. Thank you for your help, strangers (now friends) of Reddit. \nWhat I did: Let the butter cook down and used a lower heat than I normally do. Once it was enough I added the flour and mixed it very well with a whisk. I added room temp milk slowly and whisked it to hell. Then once I waited a bit, I took it off of the heat and slowly added some cheese slices and....SELF shredded cheese (mozz and cheddar)!! Oh also some cheese whiz which I saw recommended. I let it melt instead of cooking it! Then I whisked and combined it well and there was not a single ounce of graininess: perfection. Added dry mustard, cayenne and pepper :) then I broiled it with more cheese in the oven and ive never had a more creamy, smooth cheese sauce! \n\nI could cry.

Measure out your fat and flour for the roux. On lowish heat make sure if you use butter all the water is evaporated from it - not just melted butter used immediately. Add flour, stir stir stir, cook it down on low heat till it's incorporated and a minute or two past that. \n\nThen add milk. Add a little at a time. First it clumps terribly then it gets thick and liquid then it gets thin like it's just milk. You use 1 tbsp / 1 tbsp / 1 cup as your ratios.  \n\nThen you keep gently simmering until your bechamel gets actually a bit thick instead of just watery. \n\nThen you can kill the heat, I just use the lowest heat possible instead. \n\nThen you add cheese. A little at a time, stir to incorporate. Like maybe a half handful. Make sure you shred your own cheese. \n\nThis will work every time and give you good cheese sauce. You need a shitload of cheese for baked mac and cheese, like, at minimum 1.5 pounds cheese to 1 pound dry pasta.\n\nEdit: OP, just saw your update. I'm glad you got it perfect!!\n\n(Also, thank you folks very much for liking my comment. There's lots of techniques and alternative takes in the comments below, so thanks for that too.)"

Once again, the result was a dish that was \"ok,\" but still far blander, less sweet, less rich, and less flavorful than curries I get at restaurants. One piece of advice I read online was to triple the amount of spices because many curry recipes simply suggest using a lower amount than is used in restaurants. I tried that while making this dish a second time and the result was the same.\n\nI'm a little beside myself. I love these curries in restaurants and I want to make them at home, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Please, any help would be appreciated.\n\nNote since this recipe gives you options: I used ghee.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the post title typo.\n\nEdit the second: Hi everyone, thanks for all of your advice, you offered much more than I was expecting so I'm going to have to come back and finish reading through them tomorrow.",

Quite often what is happening is the starches in the rice recrystallize and the rice *feels* dryer, even though a lot of the moisture is still trapped inside. Different rice varieties have different types of starch which make some more or less susceptible to this effect. Also, addition of oils can have an effect. See more here: https://www.cooksillustrated.com/science/860-articles/story/word-of-the-week-retrogradation\n\nThe good news is that often the process is reversed by reheating which melts the starch again. This is why cooking days-old rice (say, for fried rice) doesn't result in super dry tasting rice even though the rice feels pretty dry out of the fridge."

I eat hot food but some places will ruin a dish by just making it dry with the amount of pepper flakes they put on it. Truthfully, you can almost always order a 3 or 2 and it will be fine. Not disgustingly unbalanced but also not missing the heat. Now for the more detailed answer. \n\nIn thai food they don't use chili oil very often. It exists as a product of China but they don't use it nearly at all. Some regional foods are hotter than others and it can determine which type of chili is used. Some use dried, some use less spicy but fresh peppers. Eastern Thai (also called Issan Thai) is the hottest regional cuisine but northern Thai is genrally not that spicy by comparison. I don't believe in artificially scaling heat.  Thai food is all about balance of flavor with heat being a key component. Not all thai food it naturally hot. Some is disturbingly spicy. Next time you go to your local spot, don't order pad thai or massaman curry or something normal like that. Instead try something like;\n\nLaap/Larb/Laab/Meat Salad with stick rice\nKra Prao (or something pronounced like kapow)\nOr my favorite, Khao Soi\n\nLaap is a mixed bag on how its made but when done well, it's the absolute best.\n\nEdit; I'm glad this helped lots of people it seems.

I\u2019ll make simple scrambled eggs for breakfast (butter in the pan + eggs + salt and pepper) or white rice to have with dinner (usually made in an Instant Pot but occasionally on the stove) and they\u2019ll sometimes taste so soapy to her that she can\u2019t eat them. The other big culprit are to-go coffee cups \u2013 she said that all of our plastic to-go cups made her coffee taste soapy. A few months ago we switched to ceramic to-go cups with plastic lids (I think these have silicon for the seal), and now she says that the plastic lids taste/smell soapy. \n\nAny ideas what the culprit might be? It\u2019s quite frustrating when I spend time cooking a meal and then she has to eat something else entirely.\n\nOther notes:\n\n-I have never tasted the soapy taste, and I believe her mom was over for dinner once and also couldn\u2019t taste the alleged soapiness. \n\n-I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s ever noticed the soapy taste at a restaurant or in takeout food. The one exception is cardamom \u2013 she says it tastes soapy to her in large quantities, and she\u2019s picked up on that in a couple of baked goods and also a mango lassi from an Indian restaurant once. I don\u2019t have any cardamom at home and never cook with it.\n\n-She likes cilantro and it doesn't taste soapy to her.\n\n-This has happened for years and across multiple apartments so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s our dishwasher. We also hand wash our dishes occasionally, and I make a point to rinse everything thoroughly.\n\n-I\u2019ve tried cooking the eggs in a nonstick skillet and also stainless steel, and both have produced \u201csoapy\u201d eggs.\n\n-My wife has had regular doctor\u2019s appointments and bloodwork done over the years, so I don\u2019t suspect it\u2019s any kind of big medical issue. She does have chronic migraines though. This also has been going on since before she ever had COVID.",

        "selftext": "Unfortunately our catering fell through last minute, and because it\u2019s 2022, everyone has rescheduled their wedding to this summer, post corona (I\u2019m in a European country that is pretty much back to normal). It\u2019s tough to find another solution.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty low-key wedding - think beach house and bonfires with relaxed food, from around 12 on Saturday to Sunday breakfast. We\u2019re looking to do three meals - the main lunch, a late night snack and a simple continental breakfast. \n\nFor the main meal, we\u2019re planning something like porcetta/roast pork, potato salad and a couple of green salads with a bunch of bread at around 2:30 in the afternoon. Also thinking Rick Stein\u2019s onion tart for the vegetarians (around 10 people). We get the keys to the house Friday night so we\u2019re going to caramelize the onions for the tarts in the days before, and then prep as much as possible the night before. Jury is out on whether we bake bread or buy it from a bakery, as there aren\u2019t many bakeries nearby.\n\nFor late night snacks, the plan is simple hotdogs, and for breakfast - buns, cheese, jam and LOTS of coffee.\n\nThe wedding is in a house that is usually used to cater to scout groups of around 60, so the equipment and space is there. We\u2019re just 3-4 people that have never catered for groups bigger than around 15-20 people. We\u2019d just love some advice, really, especially on what kind of numbers are realistic to portion per person? Do we just buy our food via a supermarket, or is it worth it to try to source it more in bulk? There isn\u2019t really a Costco equivalent here. Does the menu sound doable? Is the timing of the meal good or will people get hungry? Any advice is welcome! I fully expect to hear we\u2019re idiots for taking this on ourselves, but I\u2019ve accepted my fate and chose to post anyway. \n\nTo sum up numbers  - 60 people, most guests are early 30s, with around 10 family members who are plus 50 and expecting serious food and meat. Only 3 are kids (below 2 years). 10 vegetarians and 3 pregnant ladies.\n\nI\u2019m also looking for rough numbers for alcohol, but this might not be the right place for that. We\u2019re in a country that typically drinks a LOT (Scandinavia).\n\nEdit - corrected Rock Stein to Rick. Sorry, Rick\n\nEdit 2 - Thanks so much to everyone for all the input! It has helped a lot. The consensus here has been that we will look into getting a hog roast and grill master to accompany it - that seems doable. We will buy bread and either heat on the day from frozen, or assign a guest bread duty, and then just deal with salads and tarts the night and days before. We have already hired 2 family friends to do service, but as the event is so low key, it will be help yourself drinks from a paddling pool and pour it yourself wine on the tables. The 2 of them should be enough to keep things rolling along, especially if we have the grill master.\n\nThere are unfortunately no take out options nearby for late night snacks, but we've decided to move it earlier based on feedback regarding meal times, so will do either pasta bar, or kebab trays around 8-9 at night, based on mood. \n\nEveryone who suggested other caterers or just getting take out - the lack of nearby options is very limited, but so is budget, so we really can't just throw money at the problem, unfortunately. The pig roast option seems doable within the budget if I can find something this late, though. Doing a clam or crab bake in Northern Europe would be UNREAL expensive, though I love the idea!",

If you use carnarolli instead of arborio, it comes back up to temperature with a slightly better texture (in my opinion).  I worked at a place that did a ton of risotto and we did a few sheet pans on Friday and Saturday nights.  During the week, we were able to do it to order without getting weeded too much.  \n\nIt helps to have some sheet pans in the freezer while it's cooking, and also to double stack them - so if you have two sheet pans, use four sheet pans.  As soon as it's coming of the stove, scrape it onto the sheet pans, spread it out evenly with a wet spatula and then into the cooler.  Just like you need to have your iceboat ready for poached shrimp, you ned to have sheet pans cold and also a space reserved on the speed rack before you start cooking the rice.  Also best not to finish with cream or any other dairy until you're doing the pickup from the line.  Just the rice, stock and seasoning.  And another thing: you're shooting for 75-80% of the way cooked, but start getting it out off the pan at about 60-70% of the way, sounds weird, but it will make sense when you do it."

If you really want to skip most of it the last two paragraphs sum it up pretty well starting at the asterisk.\n\nI wanted to pose a question to any other US cooks or chefs in this sub, only asking for US because I don\u2019t know what the environment is like overseas but if you have input feel free. I first noticed it on the line but as a sous chef I can shut it down really quick and there aren\u2019t any issues (as far as I know.) But then I started noticing it in culinary groups on a very popular social media app, you know the one, and I have seen a lot less of it here which is where I got the idea to ask it on this sub. Plus reddit tends to tolerate longer posts.\n\nSee there seems to be this culture in kitchens developing where you need to have thick skin. Let me clarify, it\u2019s always been like that, It\u2019s a fast paced environment and things can quickly get heated on the line between two cooks. You have to be able to get called out and remake something you messed up and just move on. The general mood is you aren\u2019t allowed to have your feelings hurt. However when it comes to learning the trade and getting better, I think there should be a little more acceptance. This doesn\u2019t mean that during service I\u2019m not going to say \u201cwhat the hell is this? Do it over.\u201d But I\u2019ve started to see a kind of \u201cbullying\u201d trend towards newer cooks. Almost like a \u201cI got treated like poo so now I\u2019m going to do it to someone else.\u201d Sort of thing.\n\nFor example I\u2019m in my 30s, let\u2019s say I had never learned to ride a bicycle, then post a video of me riding for the first time in a bicycle groups and ask for tips. Maybe I even fall in the video. \n\nI already know that would be super embarrassing, but in the interest of improving I post it on a biking group because I like bikes and they all seem to know a lot about them, but in doing so basically get laughed out of the group and essentially canceled. May even say screw it and go back to driving or walking everywhere. I then have to remove my video and maybe lurk in the group to try and get tips.That\u2019s what I see happen to new cooks in a lot of the groups on a regular basis even ones that are allegedly dedicated to helping others. \n\n*Laugh reacts, telling people to hang their chef coat up, making fun of them, then if the OP genuinely gets upset memes start popping up about how wimpy they are for getting their feelings hurt. My advice has been not to post in groups looking for guidance and just find a few good people you can reach out to for help, but all of these toxic chefs/cooks are all people that will be clocking into their job, this is their attitude and the culture they bring in with them.\n\nI typically call people out when I see them and try to offer something constructive to the OP, but just this last week someone all but gave up trying to improve over this weird bullying trend I\u2019ve been seeing. Have you seen this type of behavior carry over into the real world? If so how have you dealt with it? Do you think it\u2019s a leadership issue or just an attitude being popularized by hot head alcoholic celebrity chefs?*",

                "body": "It\u2019s perpetuated by hothead chefs and the fraternity idea that everyone has to undergo hazing. Fortunately there are significant improvements I\u2019ve seen in the last couple decades since I started cooking professionally. In my own kitchen, we do not allow yelling, swearing, or publicly dressing-down other cooks. If someone makes a mistake you wait until after service and take them aside to talk about it.\n\nIt does mean in some ways things are less efficient as prep cooks don\u2019t have that fire under their ass to produce faster or get screamed at. But we more than make up for that in extremely low turnaround. Our cooks start with us and stay with is so we have great institutional knowledge which saves us a ton of effort in hiring and training. End of the day it works better for morale, morality, and the bottom line.\n\nI also think Gordon Ramsay in particular has a lot of blame on his shoulders for this. He saw the ratings that the shouty chef personality got him on TV and just went with it. The result is generations of cooks who think it\u2019s acceptable to behave like an asshole to coworkers, and highly toxic, macho kitchens that make work unfairly difficult, especially for women and minorities.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear. I didn't mean to imply that Ramsay started this. The abusive kitchen has existed for a LONG time (read Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London, or Jacques Pepin's memoirs, E.G.), just that in the age of the celebrity chef, Ramsay became the poster child for the idea that you need to abuse your staff in order to get good results, and consequently, many young cooks these days think it's OK to behave that way because a guy like Gordon Ramsay has given them his blessing. He didn't create abusive chef culture, but he has historically gone out of his way to use his incredibly huge influence to perpetuate it, and it makes me sad to think of the number of young cooks who have had to face abusive, toxic work environments due to Ramsay's wide-reaching influence."

        "selftext": "My grandfather often talks about [these buttercream cakes](https://imgur.com/a/a6J2v3S) they used to sell in Shanghai back in the day (70s/80s). The sponge cake itself is milk flavored and light, not overly fluffy like a chiffon cake but not dense like a pound cake either. The buttercream is very yellow and rich, tastes heavily of butter, and isn't overly sweet. I've done some digging and came across [this article](https://archive.shine.cn/feature/ideal/In-search-of-the-old-Shanghai-sweetness/shdaily.shtml), which was super interesting and provided some historical context so I know what I'm aiming for. Lao Da Chang in Shanghai, my grandfather's favorite bakery, was opened in the 20s by a French native!\n\nThe biggest challenge is figuring out the buttercream: it's an extremely intense butter flavor. It's supposed to make your tongue feel waxy as you eat it. Definitely isn't seen anywhere today as it would be considered disgusting (way too rich, thick, and buttery)! My mom says there's no chance there's any whipped cream in it and when it's on a cake, it looks like straight butter piped out of a pastry bag.\n\nI'm deciding between making a French buttercream or a margarine based American buttercream. Because so many Europeans settled in Shanghai in the 1920s, all the bakeries of that time period had a lot of French influences, hence the idea of using a French buttercream. However, in the 1980s, because this type of cream cake was so expensive, the bakeries started subbing in margarine to cut down costs and make it more affordable to the middle class. I don't think it's a Swiss meringue buttercream since that doesn't make any sense in a historical context and I'm sure the ingredients/recipes back then weren't fussy at all. I also believe the yellow coloring is natural, so I'm leaning more towards egg yolks/butter/margarine.\n\nHere are a few questions I'm specifically thinking about:\n\n1. Can you make a French buttercream denser with extra butter flavor? I've made a regular French buttercream before but I think it's too light/fluffy compared to what my grandfather wants. Would I be able to just add a few more sticks of butter or would this ruin the composition?\n2. Would I be able to use margarine in a French buttercream? In the article it says that the margarine was subbed in when they made the cakes more affordable and that's why it became so creamy. I really want this buttercream to be as thick and rich and indulgent as possible, so I don't mind using an unhealthy ingredient.\n\nAny help at all would be so appreciated!! Thank you :)\n\nEdit: I've stocked up on Kerrygold butter since that seems to be the closest thing to the high quality butter from back in the day. I'll be making a batch of French buttercream, 100% margarine American buttercream, and this [old-fashioned margarine/butter buttercream recipe](https://www.pinkwhen.com/old-fashioned-vanilla-buttercream-frosting/) with half the sugar. I know Swiss is more buttery in flavor than French but I just really doubt old Chinese folks going through the trouble of preparing that lmao. Thanks everyone!",

        "selftext": "As noted, I'm disabled. I used to have a passion for cooking until I acquired my disability. Now, cooking is very difficult if not impossible - I've had to use a lot of microwave cooking and many other things.\n\n\nOne thing I'm looking for specifically is something I can put on my seasoned rice to make it more interesting than just seasoned rice with a bit of dark soy sauce on it. When possible, I'll put sauced chicken, but that is a *lot* of work for me so I'm looking for options that could let me have rice as an interesting dish more often than once every four months..\n\n\nMy first thought for \"What goes well with rice?\" was what sort of things are in sushi. Based on that, I'd be interested in sweet tofu, savoury tofu, and the light green and stringy \"seaweed salad\" in some sushi which I believe is called wakame. Do any of these things come in jars or a preserved form, like Sauerkraut does? I'm also looking for minimal spice, which unfortunately rules out a lot of the Korean pickled cabbages I'd love to try, but if there are non-spicy flavoured Korean sauces/spreads/toppings that would go well I'd love to try them too. I'm also very interested in any of the things put over rice for easy meals in Chinese cuisine - I'm thinking of the sort of thing a Chinese college student might throw over rice in 3 minutes total, from a jar or a packet, to make a quick meal. I thought maybe the Chinese beef sauce I see used a lot could work? Apologies for definitely butchering that description. Doing so would probably take me more than 15 minutes even seated, and that would be a pretty hard limit on my activity.\n\n\nI am interested in suggestions from any other cultures which have easy jarred or foil packet toppings I could put on rice to make it a bit more interesting, don't feel limited to the cuisines I mentioned. I will try and locate it or an equivalent that I can get delivered here (Australia), but I recognise it's a lot of work to find that out so please just hit me with a suggestion if you think it would fit my use case.\n\n\nThank you all in advance, would really appreciate some help with this.",

Learn large dice, then cut that into medium and small. Cut batons, cut that into small dice. Cut julienne, cut that into brunoise. Make sure your knife is sharp as all fuck. Go \\*slow\\* and be super precise at first. Make them perfect, don't go for speed. You'll get faster over time. Practice this literally like 15-30 minutes per day every day (or more if you like), because that's how you get good. That's how I spent the first few months of culinary school.\n\nLearn how to emulsify a vinaigrette from scratch. Make mayonnaise from scratch. Make stock, and then learn to make the mother sauces (Instant pot is fucking fabulous for this, by the way...it's good to learn how to make a chicken stock from scratch once and skim it and stuff, but honestly if you have the IP don't bother after that, and don't bother making beef or veal stock without one).\n\nlearn how to make consomme.\n\nMove onto making the perfect seared airline chicken breast and steak. Key if you're cooking at home though is to dry the meat in the fridge uncovered overnight, you get a much better crust that way.\n\nLearn how to make a pan sauce from the pan you've cooked your meats in.\n\nLearn to poach chicken and fish in a flavorful broth.\n\nLearn to make great polenta, rice, rice pilaf, and a couple other grains of your choice.\n\nLearn how to properly blanch veggies and finish them in a nice buttery sauce.\n\nLearn how to make a roast. Learn how to braise (in school we made a cartouche--a braising lid out of parchment paper)\n\nPractice some basic plating. Everyone has different styles, so spend some time googling around and see what you like. Cutting meats on a bias and trimming veggies on a bias makes things hecka fancy looking and takes no extra time.\n\nLEARN HOW TO SEASON WITH SALT PROPERLY. If you're not sure, keep adding more and more and tasting every single fucking thing every step of the way until it's too much. Most of the time people don't realize how much salt things need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost importantly though--learn the food science. Culinary school didn't teach as much of this as I would have liked, but it's so goddamn important to know if you want to be able to get very good. Otherwise you're just repeating what you've practiced, and that might not be the best approach if you don't understand why what you're doing is great.

Every time I\u2019ve made it at Christmas, my dad always says: \u201cTastes just like mom\u2019s but it doesn\u2019t have 3 layers like hers.\u201d\n\nWell it\u2019s Easter, so once again I\u2019ve taken up my apron in the hopes of catching my white whale and achieving the 3 layers. It\u2019s in the fridge right now and only time will tell but something tells me, my harpoon has missed yet again.\n\nI know a lot of people say this dessert has two layers but I\u2019ve come across comments of people saying their mother or grandmother made it with 3 layers. From what I remember the 3rd layer was very small and basically in the middle of it. You had the custard-like base, the jello-y thin layer (the elusive 3rd layer) and then the top layer which is covered in small bubbles and is a lighter airy layer.\n\nI\u2019ve tried folding in the egg whites when the mix is overly cooled down (basically transforms it into a single homogeneous dessert), I tried when it\u2019s still warm (creates a really weird 2 layer version), tried when it\u2019s just room temperature which just creates the 2 layered normal version. I try different things every time. This time, I followed the recipe from my newer edition printed copy of Five Roses (the recipe I\u2019m posting is from my mom\u2019s 1980s version which is what my grand-maman used). In my version it says to bloom the gelatin in 1 cup of cold milk and put aside. Then you heat up the eggs with the rest of the milk and sugar. I chose to temper the eggs first as I didn\u2019t want to go through the fuss of a double boiler. Then you add in your bloomed gelatin and cook until dissolved. The rest is the same. Would love any help in solving this decades old mystery. \n\nSo without further ado, the recipe from Five Roses Cookbook (circa 1980s)\n\nSPANISH CREAM\n\n-3 egg yolks \u00a0\n-750 mL milk/ 3 cups\n-50 mL sugar/ \u00bc cup\n-1 mL salt/ \u00bc tsp.\n-2-7 g unsweetened gelatin/ 2-\u00bc oz\n-7 mL vanilla/ 1\u00bd tsp.\n-3 egg whites, at room temperature \u00a0\n-125 mL sugar/ \u00bd cup\n\nBeat egg yoks with fork. Add milk, 50 mL sugar and salt and beat well. Sprinkle gelatin on top. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until slightly thickened and gelatin completely dissolved, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Cool in refrigerator until mixture has the consistency of an egg white. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gradually beat in 125 mL sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Beat gelatin mixture until smooth and fold beaten egg whites into gelatin mixture. Pour into serving dish, rinsed with cold water or dessert cups. Chill in refrigerator until set, 2 to 3 hours. Unmould and serve with Melba Sauce (page 153) or frozen strawberries or raspberries, thawed.\n\nMould: 1.5 L (6 cups)\n\nYield: 6 to 8 servings",

        "selftext": "We're fairly decent at cooking. We've bought all kinds of chicken breast (fresh, frozen, organic, costco, etc). We've done brining, velveting, boiled (for soup), baked, grilled, stir-fry, etc. We only use boneless, skinless breasts which I know will be one of the tougher cuts to deal with having no fat, bone, skin... but. \n\n\nTonight we had a childhood favorite of my wife's, potato chip chicken. As basic as it sounds, crushed potato chip crust, baked. Breasts are sliced in half, egg wash, crushed lays classic chips. We cook to 160ish and let it rest. It's quite juicy, so not dry at all. \n\n\nThe texture/grain is very thick, some parts are very tough, the flavor is very \"chicken-y\". There are different textures throughout the breast so that even with a steak knife it is hard/weird to cut and some parts are chewy or oddly textured. Leftovers taste pretty bad, with a real meaty smell/taste, I can't eat them. \n\nMeanwhile, there is a local basic restaurant that I'll get a cob salad at and the diced chicken has a tight grain, looks very different than the stuff we could make at home and has little \"chicken-y\" flavor. And it seems no matter what chicken I buy that is already prepared (left overs from a restaurant, frozen breaded breast strips, pre-cooked pieces from costco that last weeks in the fridge) they all taste better, have a good texture and last longer. \n\nAre we doing something wrong? Are we buying inferior meat? Please help us AskCulinary as I'm beginning to not even want to eat chicken meals anymore.\n\n**Edit - Don't know why the post was locked, but thank you to everyone for their input. I think we're going to at least start with going to TJ's or similar and try out what they have to offer. Also will work on trying some cooking methods like sous vide to see what kind of result we can get. It does sound like \"woody\" is the issue here more than anything. Flavor isn't really an issue in terms of seasoning, we do plenty of things like fajitas where the chicken is marinated for some time and has a ton of seasoning. As long as the texture was right it would be great.",

All better with butter.\n\nI think there is a stronger tradition of butter with beef because traditionally you could have gotten those two from the same farmer.\n\nAs for why beef tastes better with butter then oil.  I think it has to do with our taste sense of fats/lipids.  So recently there has been the discovery of g-coupled protein receptors for fats.  So we have dedicated taste receptors for fats/fatty acids. \n\nNow if you look at the chemical composition of butter and oil there's one stark difference.  The lipids in milk/butter are shorter (primarily of carbon chains of 4, 6, 8 and 10).  The lipids derived from plants tend to be longer (carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being the most common).  Interesting, looking at beef fat(tallow, also other animal based fats are similar) it is very similar to plant fats with carbon chains of 14, 16 and 18 being predominant.\n\nSo my theory is that these short lipids (C:4-10) hit our lipid g-coupled protein receptors on our tounges different and butter fills in that flavour profile.  For one, smaller molecules have more mobility and could potentially get to our lipid receptors more readily then longer chain fats.  Also, the receptors themselves could be more susceptible to shorter chain fats much like our amino acid receptors are most susceptible to glutamate.\n\nAnd I do think it's the fats instead of some other flavour in butter because fats+water in butter makes up 98%-99% of its composition.  The others will help, but this is how I see it."

It's not that I'm not following the recipes correctly. The ones I've tried have all been delicious - they're just not what I'm looking for. \n\nWhat I'm trying for and failing to replicate is the particular and uniquely straightforward taste of Mexican rice from a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. The rice they serve there doesn't even remotely taste tomatoey - hell, the only flavors I can really identify are:\n\n- salt\n- MSG\n- garlic\n\nI can detect almost nothing else. The rice is colored orange and based on the texture, it was likely toasted/fried in oil prior to cooking. The rice itself seems to be enriched parboiled long grain. There are no little bits of vegetables or onions in it - it's just the rice. Maybe Saz\u00f3n was used, but my rice seems to be missing something when I just make it with Saz\u00f3n. Any ideas?",

Chickens begin laying eggs at about five months of age, but turkeys don\u2019t have their first cycle until more than two months later. Commercial egg producers typically, although controversially, allocate less than 50 square inches of space to a hen. Turkeys are given more than 3 square feet, enough to accommodate eight chicken hens. Turkeys also require more food than chickens. These factors combine to make turkey eggs far more expensive than chicken eggs. A dozen chicken eggs currently cost approximately $1.61. (Cage-free eggs cost twice as much.) There\u2019s no nationwide data on the cost of turkey eggs\u2014the USDA doesn\u2019t even have grading regulation for turkey eggs\u2014but many producers sell them for $2 to $3 per egg.\u201d"

Think what you would use at a butcher shop, in a meat room at a grocery, at a catering place with 30 prep cooks and 100 house knives.  \n\nWhat you have are artisan knives, good/required for certain professional uses that aren\u2019t heavy volume.

Since 1992, we have been serving traditional recipes direct from Britanny! In a cozy and friendly country French atmosphere, you will enjoy Cr\u00eapes, Quiches, and a handful of authentic French dishes. For a romantic dinner or a casual family dining.\"\n\nTheir Yelp listing also has the menu for the Thursday Specials. According to that and reviews by diners they served Vichyssoise, Soupe du Jour and Soupe de Poisson. One reviewer said that the \"Soup of the day was a spice fish stew, excellent and spicy.\" They also served Trout Bretonne which makes it more likely that the soup you had is their version of a classic Bretagne-style fish soup.\n\nTake a look at this call for [Help finding recipe for Bretagne-style fish soup?] (https://www.chowhound.com/post/finding-recipe-bretagne-style-fish-soup-1029785) on Chowhound. There are lots of suggestions on how to make an authentic fish soup. \n\nOne of the links listed on the Chowhound page is Anthony Bourdain's recipe for [Soupe de Poisson](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/soupe-de-poisson) which instructs the cook to \"crush the heads, bones, and vegetables as much as possible, then pass that through the food mill in batches. Return to the pot along with the strained broth\" and \"serve with croutons, rouille, and some grated Parmesan on the side. The idea is to smear a little rouille on the croutons, float them in the soup as a garnish\".\n\nAnd one notable comment is, \"The number one rule is: BONES. You need fish bones, therefore whole fish, that's what gives the soup its characteristic taste. Using just fish fillets will get you fish puree, nice but that's not soupe de poissons. And if you can obtain a little more taste, it's all the better, hence the trick of adding some small green crabs, shrimp or small langoustines to the broth. That is why the soup is often called \"soupe de poissons de roche\"\".\n\nhth"

I\u2019ve added butter, more butter, three quarters of a stick of butter. I\u2019ve stirred aggressively, I\u2019ve added more pasta water. I\u2019ve tried higher temps, lower temps, adding the cheese after I throw the pasta into the pan. I\u2019ve taken the cheese out of the fridge hours ahead of time, I\u2019ve pulverized it in the food processor as the BA video suggests, and I\u2019ve tried an extremely fine microplane. \n\nThe cheese ALWAYS clumps. It always clumps. No amount of it *ever* melts into the emulsion, ever. It just sits there like grainy insult, swirling around stubbornly refusing to turn into a sauce.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m convinced Fettuccine Alfredo is actually a huge hoax, and I\u2019ve fallen for it. I just want a smooth freakin\u2019 sauce and it\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019m using real Parmesan\u2026though it is from Wisconsin, not from Parma. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of. It seems to be a high-quality cheese, not the pre-grated stuff, comes as a wedge.\n\nHow, on god\u2019s green earth, does this work?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/NepgSV1/\n\n[Edit: come back from my morning to 22 comments!

Someone else said between 60-80C is where you want to hit for temperature before adding the cheese, I'll try to keep an eye on that as well as well as not microplane my cheese, though this last time I just buzzed it in the food processor and it still made giant globby globs.]\n\n[Edit 4: A few persnickety folks here on about my use of the word \u201ctraditional\u201d and real vs \u201cfake\u201d parm.

So, for me, I look at the recipe and see what it\u2019s doing to decide what to actually do. If it says to marinate the chicken overnight in an acidic marinade I ignore and do 2 hours. Maybe I\u2019ll have dry brined it the night before with just salt. If the same marinade is being used to prepare the chicken when you cook it, that\u2019s where all the flavor is coming from. So I ignore lots of recipes that call for long marinades.

Thanks all for the advice!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/5f89NUj\n\n\nUpdate 1: 8:48 AM - Thanks everyone for your encouragement, kind words, and absolutely for your expertise. I'm going to give u/TheMau 's recommendation a shot. I've got the new crust in the oven and will be heating up some extra chocolate. I'm covering the whole top in chocolate as well, so I think the damage done by moving every thing may be minimal.   \nI'll update with a picture when its done so we can either all laugh at my attempts, or hopefully be floored by how good it looks. TBD!  \n\nOP:  \nMy wife is the baker and cook in the family. I'm the order takeout or make BLTs spouse. Has always worked well, but today is her birthday and she asked me to make a specific cheesecake. One of her love languages is \"acts of service\" and so I made sure to make that cheesecake! The problem I ran into, which appears to be a common one, is that my water barrier apparently failed.\n\nThe crust ended up not being as bad as I expected after a night in the fridge, but it still wasn't good enough. I flipped it and sawed off the old crust.Now I need some advice. She'll be happy the I tried hard, but I really want to nail this thing (or atleast put up a good showing). I don't think the cheesecake itself was affected by the leakage or atleast minimally so. I was able to saw pretty effectively.\n\nSo do I:\n\nA) Call it upside down cheescake, grind up more oreos and pretzels and sprinkle them on the top with the melted chocolateOR\n\nB) Try to bake a new crust only in the pan and put the existing cheesecake on the new crust. This seems like the ideal situation, but I don't know how to account for how long to bake JUST a crust in the oven. (Pretty obvious I don't know what I'm doing by this point in the post, eh?)\n\nI work from home - so I have some time to tinker today during breaks, but not \"make a whole new cheesecake\" kind of time. \\`\n\nAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated.

Vietnamese cilantro is in fact not even from the same family as cilantro and saw toothed coriander (knotweed family vs aster family) and though its harder to get your hands on (saw toothed coriander can be found in Mexican grocers) my bet is that it's what you had. \n\nAs an aside: I've tasted both and even tested Vietnamese cilantro on two cilantro intolerant persons. Flavorwise I prefer the Vietnamese cilantro; it's like a ever so slightly minty cilantro, whereas I've found saw tooth cilantro to have a dull flavor. And as for my tests, reactions were split, but I suspect the negative taster either strongly associated the flavor with soapyness or just simply disliked the flavor of cilantro and never suffered from the soapy taste."

This is a very clever trick and is probably a traditional variation that she learned from her grandmother who learned it from her grandmother as well.  It isn\u2019t thickening, so don\u2019t think of it as roux, think of it like you would think of pressing bits of cold butter into flour for a pasty crust, but the opposite - no thin flakes of butter like a croissant or puff pastry would have, more of a saturated flour that can disperse and make the bread tender.\n\nBravo grandma \ud83d\udc4f"
