The pan is covered with a lid and the flame or intensity of heat is reduced. The product obtained is slightly moist and tender but without any liquid or gravy. Foods cooked by sauteing are generally vegetables. MERITS: Takes less time. Simple technique. Minimum oil is used. DEMERITS: Scorching or burning is possible if not watched closely. Type of method: Dry heat methods. Healthy Cooking Method: Sauté\n",
